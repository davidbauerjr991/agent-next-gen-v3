         CLAUDE.md's "Rule zero: never hand-roll a button" was previously
         documentation only — nothing actually caught a violation short of
         a human noticing in a screenshot (see the "Scroll To Latest" pill,
         built as a raw `<button>` with guessed styling instead of
         composing `Button`). `npm run lint` was ALSO silently broken this
         whole time (no `eslint.config.js` existed at all, so every run
         failed outright before evaluating a single file) — meaning this
         rule had zero enforcement from either direction. This restriction
         makes a bare `<button>` a hard lint error anywhere in this app's
         `src/`, forcing `Button`/`ActionIconButton`/an existing lyra-ui
         button atom instead. lyra-ui itself is a separate repo/lint config
         — its own components (panel-pin-button.tsx, etc.) legitimately
         build on native `<button>`, so this rule only applies here, the
         consuming app. */

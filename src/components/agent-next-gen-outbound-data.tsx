//
// Deliberately NOT applied to `OUTBOUND_CONFIG.groups` below (a real,
// confirmed bug this used to have): `OUTBOUND_CONFIG` is the single
// shared object every tier page spreads into its own `outboundConfig`,
// which feeds BOTH the New Outbound picker's own browsable group list
// AND `useOutboundAddButton`'s `contactsById` lookup (lyra-ui,
// create-new.tsx) — the map `getHeaderAction` uses to resolve an
// already-known customer's "+" (Add Channel) button on the record
// header/`InteractionNavItem`. Filtering "customers" out of
// `OUTBOUND_CONFIG.groups` itself hid it from BOTH, so any real,
// directory-backed customer interaction (started via the Customers
// desk-tab table or the Search panel's Customers sub-tab — Advanced/
// Premium tiers, which are supposed to keep the full group list, per
// each tier's own `outboundConfig` memo doc comment) silently fell back
// to the plain `AddChannelAdHocButton` instead of `OutboundAddButton`,
// since `contactsById.get(interaction.id)` could never find a match:
// the confirmed root cause of "both the InteractionNavItem and the
// header toggle group show the custom [ad-hoc] input" for a known
// Advanced-tier customer found via Search. Each tier's own `<CreateNew
// outbound={{...}}>` render call site now applies this exclusion itself
// (filtering `outboundConfig.groups`, not `OUTBOUND_CONFIG.groups`) so
// only that picker's own browsable list loses "customers" — the lookup
// map every tier's `useOutboundAddButton` builds from `outboundConfig`
// keeps it.

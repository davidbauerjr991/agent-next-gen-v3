/* ── CustomersListView ──
   Contacts list view populating the Dashboard tab row's "Customers" tab
   (`activeDeskTab === "customers"`, see the render branch below). Row
   data now comes from lyra-ui's own shared `CREATE_NEW_CUSTOMERS` fixture
   (`@nicecxone/lyra-ui/customers-data`, already imported above for the
   Outbound picker) instead of a hand-transcribed screenshot table, so
   this list view can't drift out of sync with lyra-ui's "customer
   database" — see create-new-customers-data.ts, which now carries
   firstName/lastName/group/firstPhone/emailAddress/address1/city/state/
   postalCode fields (added alongside its pre-existing id/name/customerId/
   channels/avatarClassName) specifically so this table has real columns
   to render.

   The UI itself is a direct, trimmed port of lyra-ui's own "Data
   Management" template (DataManagement.stories.tsx's
   `DataManagementTemplate`) — same state shape (`sortKey`/`sortDir`/
   `handleSort`/`dirFor`, `useColumnReorder`, `visibleCols`/
   `ColumnToggle`, `filterValues`/`filterDefs`, row-selection
   `Checkbox`es, real `currentPage`/`rowsPerPage`-driven pagination),
   same `columnConfig: Record<Key, {label, flex}>` shape (proportional
   `flex-[n]` ratios, no per-column `min-w-[…]` floor — that floor is
   what made the table wider than its container earlier), same render
   shape (`TableToolbar` → `Table` → `TableFooter`). Left out: the
   template's own `PageHeader`/`SidePanel`/`TabList`/grouping/auto-fit —
   this embeds inside `AgentNextGenPage`'s own PageHeader/tab row, which
   already cover that job, and grouping/auto-fit weren't asked for. */

 *  explicit follow-up ("I don't want the channels to display until the
 *  agent hovers on the row - then also you have them overlapping each
 *  other which is not desirable - also remove the extra column space in
 *  the header - these icons should overlay whatever content is in the row
 *  when they display") to this hover-only, non-overlapping, zero-reserved-

 *  launch popover, own click handler), now with the plain `overlay`
 *  variant (see that prop's own doc comment) — no chip background/ring of
 *  its own, since the *shared strip* this returns supplies one opaque
 *  background and one `group-hover`-driven fade for the whole cluster.
 *  Icons are laid out with a plain `gap-1.5` (no negative margin/overlap)
 *  per the "overlapping... is not desirable" correction above. Sizing per
 *  a further explicit follow-up ("make the padding-left/right 4px for the
 *  channel icon button container, make the full border radius 6px and add
 *  4px margin-left so it feels contained within the row" — with a
 *  screenshot): `rounded-lyra-sm` (the design system's 6px radius token, on
 *  all four corners — the earlier version only rounded the trailing edge),
 *  `ml-1` (4px) so the strip doesn't sit flush against the row's own left
 *  edge. A later follow-up (another screenshot) swapped the original
 *  `pl-1`/`pr-1` (4px horizontal padding) for `my-1` (4px vertical margin,
 *  top and bottom) instead — the strip is `inset-y-0` (top:0/bottom:0)
 *  against the row, so vertical margin on top of that shrinks it to a
 *  shorter pill centered in the row with a visible gap above/below, rather
 *  than padding widening its horizontal footprint around the icons. Only

 *  call sites only) — NOT a replacement for `CustomerChannelCell` itself,
 *  which stays exactly as-is for every other consumer. */

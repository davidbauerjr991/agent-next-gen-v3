/* ── Transcript + Composer ──
   Split out of AgentNextGenPage.tsx (which had grown past Babel's 500KB
   code-generator threshold — see that file's own top-of-file note): every
   message-bubble/session/transcript/composer piece that renders an
   interaction's actual conversation, plus the mock session/message data
   that seeds it. Genuinely self-contained — per a dependency-graph script
   run before the split, nothing here references any OTHER
   AgentNextGenPage-specific type/component/mock-data by name (only
   `agent-next-gen-shared-utils.ts`'s pure helpers) — so this file sits at
   the same "no incoming feature-file dependencies" tier as that one, just
   one level up. `AgentNextGenPage` itself imports `InteractionTranscript`/
   `InteractionComposer` (the two real render entry points) plus a handful
   of types/constants (`TranscriptMessage`, `OUTCOME_TAG_OPTIONS`, etc.)
   still referenced from its own outcome-popover/notification code. */

/* Each `Contact` is one contact record within the interaction —
   the reference screenshot's "# CTX-20250722-08841 · July 22, 2025 ⌄"
   separator plus the "Session Details" panel it expands to (Contact ID /
   Date / Start / End / Channel / Skill / Agent / Status). A single
   interaction can span more than one session (a callback, a follow-up
   message thread days later, etc.) — grouping `TranscriptMessage[]` under
   a session rather than one flat list is what lets the transcript render a
   separator between each and let every one collapse/expand independently.
   Two mock sessions here (a closed first contact, then a shorter follow-up)
   are enough to demonstrate the separator-per-session + sticky-stacking
   behavior; still a UI prototype, not real per-interaction session data.
   Session info (this separator + its Session Details panel) is shown for
   every channel type — Voice/Email get their own sibling arrays just below
   (`TRANSCRIPT_SESSIONS_VOICE`/`TRANSCRIPT_SESSIONS_EMAIL`), each with an
   empty `messages: []` since neither channel has designed transcript
   content yet (a call recording/summary UI, an email thread UI) — the
   session separator and its expandable details still apply to a call or an
   email the same as they do to a chat, it's only the message-by-message
   body underneath that's still a placeholder. See `InteractionTranscript`'s
   per-session render below for where that placeholder actually shows. */

   `InteractionTranscript` already owns and threading them straight
   through. `ChatMessage` now owns the actual bubble/toolbar/tags markup
   (ported from what used to be hand-rolled directly in this function —
   the two were kept in sync by hand for a while, this replaces that with
   a real shared component) — see that component's own doc comment
   (chat-message.tsx, lyra-ui) for the one deliberate layout change it
   made along the way: the timestamp now sits before the name in the
   header row ("9:51 AM · John Smith") instead of its own line inside the

   two fields per row. Uses lyra-ui's own documented "Label Horizontal"
   pattern (`Input.stories.tsx`'s `LabelHorizontalWithSeparator` story: the
   real `Label` atom on the left, a plain `lyra-body-md text-lyra-fg-
   secondary` value span on the right, in one row) rather than `Input` —
   `Input` always stacks its label *above* the field, which read as a
   normal editable-looking form regardless of `readonly`, not the
   horizontal label/value row the reference screenshot shows. Same pattern
   minus that story's trailing `Separator` — explicitly no dividers between
   rows here, this card is one glanceable block, not a divided list. Two
   pairs per row via `.lyra-form-grid` (an existing lyra-tokens.css
   container-query family, not a bare Tailwind `grid-cols-2`) under a
   `lyra-form-grid-wrap` boundary, same mechanism `CustomerDetailTabContent`
   uses for its own 2-up field rows.

   Wrapped in the same neutral `rounded-lyra-md border border-lyra-border-
   subtle bg-lyra-bg-control-subtle` container CONTRIBUTING.md's "Composing
   panel body content" convention uses for a card-like block sitting inside

/* ── TranscriptSessionSeparator ──
   The "# CTX-... · <date>" pill row between sessions. `sticky top-0` (no
   extra plumbing needed — this relies on plain CSS sticky-header stacking:
   each separator is the first child of its own session block, in normal
   document flow as a sibling of the next session block below it, so as the
   transcript's own `overflow-y-auto` container scrolls, a separator sticks
   to the top for as long as its session's messages are still scrolling by,
   then gets pushed off-screen the instant the *next* session block's own
   top — and therefore its own separator — reaches the scroll container's
   top edge. That hand-off is the "then it replaces the other one" behavior
   from the request; no scroll listener or IntersectionObserver needed for
   it, just each separator being `sticky top-0` in source order.
   `bg-lyra-bg-surface-base` keeps messages scrolling underneath from
   showing through while it's pinned; `z-[1]` keeps it above them —
   deliberately *not* `z-10`: `CustomerInformationSidePanel` (the
   docked panel this transcript sits beside) renders at `z-[5]`
   (side-panel.tsx), and a sticky element's own `z-index` opens a new
   stacking context compared against siblings up the tree, not just against
   the messages scrolling directly beneath it — `z-10` was outranking that
   panel and painting the separator/expanded Session Details card over top
   of it once the panel had content past the fold (confirmed via
   screenshot). `z-[1]` is enough to clear plain in-flow message content
   (which has no z-index of its own) while staying under every panel in
   this file that intentionally layers above the transcript.

   The trailing gradient div is the same "soft fade instead of a hard edge"
   technique `InteractionComposer` uses for its own top edge (see that
   component's doc comment), mirrored: `position: sticky` already
   establishes a containing block for an absolutely-positioned descendant
   (same as `relative` would), so no extra wrapper is needed here. Placed
   at `-bottom-8` (outside this div's own box, extending down into the
   messages scrolling underneath) rather than as internal bottom padding,
   so it overlays whatever message content is passing directly beneath the
   separator instead of just adding empty space inside it. Gradient runs
   solid (matching this bar's own background) at the top down to
   transparent at the bottom — the reverse of the composer's direction,
   since here the solid edge is at the *top* of the fade band, not the
   bottom.

   "View Details" used to expand `TranscriptSessionDetails` inline right
   below this pill, animated via lyra-ui's headless accordion building
   blocks (AccordionHeadless/-Item/-Content) — plain `div`s now (see
   `onViewDetails`'s own doc comment below): per explicit request, it opens
   an external `InteriorPanel` instead (`InteractionTranscript`'s own
   `onViewSessionDetails` prop), so there's no open/closed state left here
   to animate. `openSessionIds`/`toggleSession` (the state that used to
   drive the accordion's `value`) are gone from `InteractionTranscript` for
   the same reason.

   The status `Tag` (e.g. "Resolved") used to be plain decoration inside
   the same big toggle button as the rest of the pill. It's now its own
   `Popover` trigger, pulled out of that button into a sibling — clicking
   it opens a status list (`Menu`, `bare` since `Popover`'s own content
   wrapper already supplies the surface) instead of toggling Session
   Details, so the two actions (change status / expand details) don't
   fight over one click target. Picking "Closed" swaps that same popover's
   `content` to a confirm view instead of closing it (`statusMenuView`) —
   one Popover instance, two possible bodies, not a second nested Popover —
   matching the reference screenshots' "select Closed → a warning to
   confirm" flow. Once a session's status IS "Closed", the trigger is
   `disabled` (`isClosed` below): there's no way back in from here, matching
   "closed cannot be re-opened." All the actual status state (which session
   is "Closed" now, which popover/view is open) lives in
   `InteractionTranscript` (this component owns no state of its own) —
   same reasoning `sessionMessages` already lives one level up: every
   session's status is independent, and only one status popover should
   ever be open across the whole transcript at a time. */

                      this same channel. Every other `channelType` (and
                      voice/sms with no `channelType`/`direction` passed at
                      all) renders no icon here, exactly as before this

                (still the exact same `onDismiss` handler underneath — see
                that branch just below) rather than disappearing entirely:
                per explicit follow-up request, a closed channel still needs
                a way to clear it out of the assignment queue, it just isn't
                "unassigning" anything live anymore. `UserX` (not a warning/
                alert glyph) — per
                explicit correction, this isn't a warning; it just removes
                the agent from the assignment, and sharing `TriangleAlert`
                with the SLA-severity tab icon made the two easy to
                confuse at a glance.
                Per later explicit follow-up request, restyled from a plain
                neutral icon button to a labeled outline-critical `Button`
                — same reasoning/exact same composed classes as the
                record-header's own now-matching copy of this button
                (Agent Workspace 2.0's icon-button cluster,
                AgentNextGenPage.tsx — see that call site's own doc comment
                for why no named `outline`+`critical` `Button` variant
                exists to reach for instead). `size="sm"` (24px) — matches
                this row's OTHER buttons (`icon-sm`, also 24px), unlike the
                header's own copy which sizes up to `md` (32px) to match
                that row's taller buttons instead.
                Per a later explicit follow-up request ("use a ghost button
                error variant"): `variant="outline"` (bordered) →
                `variant="ghost"` with the `border-lyra-status-critical-
                strong`/`hover:border-lyra-status-critical-strong` classes
                dropped — same critical-red icon color and
                `hover:bg-lyra-status-critical-subtle`/`active:bg-lyra-
                status-critical-medium` background states as before, just
                borderless now. Exactly the same `outline` → `ghost`
                treatment the record-header's own copy of this button
                already got (there's still no named `ghost`+`critical`
                `Button` variant, so this remains composed via `className`
                the same way — see that call site's own doc comment,
                AgentNextGenPage.tsx).
                For a brand-new outbound thread (`isNewThread`), this real
                button is swapped for a red trash-icon "Delete Draft"
                button instead — per explicit request, since closing a
                genuine, untouched draft (no message sent yet) actually
                deletes it outright rather than just dismissing a live
                assignment (see `onDismiss`'s own caller for the matching
                "skip Contact History" branch that pairs with this).
                Per a later explicit follow-up request ("make the delete
                icons in the session rows ghost button error variants that
                say 'Delete Draft'"): `variant="icon"` (icon-only, label
                only in the `title` tooltip) → `variant="ghost"` with the
                label rendered as visible text alongside the icon — same
                `text-lyra-status-critical-strong`/`hover:bg-lyra-status-
                critical-subtle`/`active:bg-lyra-status-critical-medium`
                "ghost + critical" color treatment the Unassign & Dismiss

  // time the agent switches to a different channel tab) — not an empty
  // array. Per explicit bug report: `InteractionTranscript` is one long-
  // lived component instance for the whole interaction (never remounted as
  // the agent flips between its channel tabs — no `key` at the call site),
  // so an empty-deps effect only ever fired once, the very first time this
  // interaction's transcript opened. Every LATER channel switch left
  // `scrollContainerRef`'s raw `scrollTop` pixel value untouched while the
  // DOM underneath it was completely replaced with a different channel's
  // (usually differently-sized) content — the agent would land wherever
  // that stale pixel offset happened to fall in the new content, which
  // read as "goes to the top" for a multi-session chat/SMS thread far more
  // often than not. Re-running this on every `contactId` change re-lands on
  // the bottom every time, matching the original "land on open" intent but
  // now firing on every channel switch, not just the very first one.

  //  - The agent's OWN just-sent message always scrolls to it, regardless of
  //    where they'd scrolled to — they just took an action in this
  //    conversation, so they should see it land, same as `scrollToLatest`
  //    below. Also resets `isAtBottom` to `true` (as if they'd clicked
  //    "Scroll To Latest" themselves), so the customer's reply a couple
  //    seconds later keeps auto-scrolling right along with it too.
  //  - The simulated customer reply only scrolls if the agent was already
  //    caught up to the bottom (`isAtBottomRef.current`, read fresh rather
  //    than depended on — see that ref's own comment) — if they've scrolled
  //    up to read earlier messages, an incoming reply shouldn't yank them
  //    back down; it only self-resumes once they scroll back down
  //    themselves (`handleTranscriptScroll`) or click "Scroll To Latest".
  // Distinguished by `liveMessages`' own last entry's `sender` — the fixed
  // mock log never changes at runtime, so any growth in `liveMessages` is
  // exactly "the agent sent one" or "the customer replied," in that order.
  // Keyed on `liveMessages.length` (a primitive), not the `liveMessages`
  // array itself — that's a fresh `[]` reference every render an

                    `TranscriptSessionSeparator` above (a SIBLING of this
                    div, same as before) — so its own `sticky top-0` keeps
                    working exactly as already documented there.
                    `w-full max-w-[768px] mx-auto px-6` — per the
                    un-revert back to full width (see the outer scroll
                    container's own doc comment above), the centered
                    column (768px, was 1024px until a later explicit
                    request — "make the max-width of the interaction
                    content 768px instead of 1024px" — narrowed it, along
                    with its two synced siblings below and in
                    agent-next-gen-voice-call-controls.tsx) moved back
                    down onto THIS wrapper, around just the message
                    content — message bubbles are unaffected visually,
                    still centered at the same width and alignment as
                    before; only the separator row above them is full
                    width again.
                    `pb-9` (36px), LAST session only — per explicit follow-up
                    request ("increase the padding-bottom of the
                    conversation container... so the bottom comments are not
                    covered by the fade"): the composer's own soft fade
                    overlay (`-top-8 h-8`, 32px, see that div's own doc
                    comment further down) paints OVER the last ~32px of
                    whichever content is scrolled to the very bottom of the
                    transcript — with only the message blocks' own `py-4`
                    (16px) below the last bubble, the fade's 32px reached up
                    into the actual text of the last message once scrolled
                    all the way down. 36px (a touch more than the fade's own
                    32px) clears it with a little room to spare. Scoped to
                    `session.id === lastSessionId` specifically — every
                    OLDER session already has real content (this session's
                    own separator, or the next session's) sitting below it
                    in the scroll, so only the truly last block in the
                    document needs the extra clearance; adding it to every
                    session would just insert an oversized, unexplained gap
                    above each one's own separator instead. Whichever
                    sub-block actually renders last for this session (canned
                    `messages`, the Voice/Email placeholder, or live
                    messages — see the three blocks below) is covered
                    either way, since this padding lives on their shared
                    parent, not on any one of them individually. */}

                    column — see that div's own doc comment for its own

                    last-session `pb-9`) is untouched — this only adds a
                    height animation around it. Still a DOM descendant of the
                    outer `<div key={session.id}>` either way, so
                    `TranscriptSessionSeparator`'s own `sticky top-0` keeps
                    working exactly as already documented there (a fully

                    are what's overflowing: a `position: sticky` element can
                    only stick for as long as its OWN containing block still

                    essentially zero and the separator unstuck itself almost
                    immediately — sticky worked for the fixed mock sessions
                    (separator + real messages sharing one container) but
                    not for a brand-new conversation (per explicit report:
                    "sticky for existing conversations but new conversations
                    ... when the conversation reaches an overflow-y it is

   list for `QuickReplyVariableForm` to collect those, keyed by each
   field's own `key`, which must match a `{key}` token in `template`
   exactly (see `fillQuickReplyTemplate` below). Plain (non-`rich`) items

/* ── InteractionComposer ──
   The message-input bar fixed to the bottom of an active interaction's
   detail page — a sibling rendered right after `InteractionTranscript`
   rather than living inside it, so it's a `shrink-0` row in the same flex
   column instead of scrolling away with the transcript above it (which is
   the `flex-1 overflow-y-auto` element doing all the scrolling).

   Composed from existing lyra-ui exports (`Textarea`, `Button`,
   `ActionIconButton`) plus the two new `QuickReplyMenu`/
   `QuickReplyVariableForm` exports for the "/trigger" quick-reply picker
   (see the "Quick replies" data block above this component). The "Send ▾"
   control is hand-built from two adjacent `Button`s (rounded-r-none /
   rounded-l-none, a hairline divider between) since lyra-ui has no
   dedicated split-button component; same reasoning as everywhere else in
   this file that composes existing atoms rather than waiting on a new
   lyra-ui primitive.

   Quick-reply mechanics: typing `/` (`QUICK_REPLY_TRIGGER_CHAR` below —
   `/` rather than `#`, per explicit request: it's the near-universal
   chat-command convention, e.g. Slack/Discord/Front/Intercom/Zendesk,
   where `#` almost always means a hashtag/channel instead) followed by
   any run of word characters with the caret still immediately after them
   (`QUICK_REPLY_TRIGGER_PATTERN` below, re-tested against the text up to
   the caret on every keystroke) opens the menu, filtered to items whose
   `id`/`title` contains what's typed so far; the (existing, previously
   unwired) "Quick replies" toolbar button opens the same menu at the
   current caret with no filter instead, for agents who'd rather browse
   than type a shortcut from memory. `quickReplyTriggerStart` records
   where the inserted/replaced range begins — either the `/`'s own
   position (typed trigger) or the bare caret (toolbar button, nothing to
   replace, pure insert). The menu itself owns no keyboard state (see
   `QuickReplyMenu`'s own doc comment) — arrow keys/Enter/Escape are all
   handled by this component's `onKeyDown` on the `Textarea` itself, so
   the textarea never loses focus/caret position while browsing. Selecting
   a plain item inserts `template` immediately; selecting a `rich` one
   swaps the same on-screen spot to `QuickReplyVariableForm` instead of
   closing, so the agent can fill in its field(s) — see
   `fillQuickReplyTemplate`'s own doc comment for the bracketed-preview-
   vs-final-insert distinction — before either inserting or cancelling
   back out (Cancel closes the whole picker rather than returning to the
   list, same "start over from `/`" flow either way).

   `onSend` hands the typed text up to `handleSendMessage` (the main
   component, where `interactions`/`setInteractions` actually live — this
   component has no access to that state itself) — that's what pushes the
   message into the active interaction's `liveMessages` and schedules the
   simulated customer reply. This component still owns nothing but the
   input's own text (and now the quick-reply picker's transient state);
   it doesn't know or care what happens to a message once sent. */

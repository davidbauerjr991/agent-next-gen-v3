// that file's own `onToggleVideo` doc comment) via each tier page's own
// `voiceVideoWindowOpen`/`voiceVideoFullScreen` state. Two components, one
// per mode:
//
//   - `VideoCallWindow` — the small, freely draggable floating window
//     (built directly on lyra-ui's `Draggable`, not `DraggablePanel` — see
//     that choice's own doc comment below). Both feeds shown STACKED
//     (customer on top, you on bottom), each at a real 16:9 "standard
//     video" aspect ratio via Tailwind's `aspect-video`, per explicit
//     request.
//   - `VideoCallFullScreen` — rendered by the tier page directly inside the
//     transcript column's own content area (NOT floating — see that
//     render site's own doc comment for why), taking over just that area:
//     the record header above and the call-controls bar below stay
//     visible, untouched. Per explicit follow-up request, this mode goes
//     back to the ORIGINAL "one big main feed + a small inset self-view
//     PIP" layout instead of the stacked one — stacking two full 16:9
//     feeds only reads right at the small window's own size.
//
// Purely decorative, same "fake it with a toast/placeholder, no real
// backing" convention every other placeholder control in this app already
// follows (see agent-next-gen-voice-call-controls.tsx's own top doc
// comment) — there's no real camera/stream in this prototype, just dark
// placeholder areas standing in for one.

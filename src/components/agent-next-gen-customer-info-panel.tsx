/* ── InteractionTranscript ──
   The conversation-transcript body for an active interaction's detail page,
   shown below the page header — whose own `titleSuffix` slot holds the
   `ChannelToggle` row now, not a separate row beneath it (replaces the
   empty placeholder div that used to sit there — see the `activeInteraction`
   branch above). Shows
   one fixed mock conversation (Liam Davis ↔ John Smith) split across two
   fixed mock sessions (`TRANSCRIPT_SESSIONS`) for every active interaction
   rather than a real per-interaction transcript — this is a UI prototype of
   the transcript layout itself, not a case-data integration.

   Only shown as-is for SMS/WhatsApp (a chat-shaped channel) — `channelType`
   picks which content renders, matching the record header's own active
   `ChannelToggle` pill: Voice and Email are placeholders ("Coming Soon
   {Voice,Email} Content") rather than the same chat transcript, since a
   voice call's or an email thread's own content genuinely doesn't look like
   a chat log and hasn't been designed yet — showing the SMS mock underneath
   either would misrepresent it as done. `customerName` swaps in for every
   customer-sender message's hardcoded mock name/initials ("Liam Davis"/
   "LD") in the SMS/WhatsApp branch, so the transcript at least reads as
   this interaction's actual customer rather than always the same fixed
   mock person; falls back to "Liam Davis" when unset (e.g. no active
   interaction) so this still renders sensibly in isolation.

   Broken into sessions (each a `# <case id> · <date>` separator — see
   `TranscriptSessionSeparator` — followed by that session's own messages)
   rather than one flat message list, per explicit request: a single
   interaction can span more than one contact record (a follow-up thread
   days later, a callback), and each one needs its own separator that
   expands in place to a "Session Details" summary (`Contact
   Details`) without disturbing the others. Each separator is `sticky
   top-0`, so scrolling through a session keeps its separator pinned at the
   top until the next session's own separator reaches the top and takes
   over — plain CSS sticky-header stacking, no scroll listener — see that
   component's own doc comment for why source order alone is enough to get
   this behavior.

   Deliberately hand-built instead of composed from lyra-ui's
   `ConversationMessage`: that component's "agent" variant doesn't produce
   the white-bordered customer bubble the reference screenshot shows (no
   variant maps to that background), and its avatar sits beside the bubble
   rather than below it next to the tag row — both would require changing
   `ConversationMessage` itself, which is off the table for this feature
   ("do not update the components in lyra-ui until i say"). The removable
   Technical/Urgent/Billing pills still reuse `Tag` unmodified — it already
   supports `onRemove` plus the purple/critical/default variants used below,
   no lyra-ui changes needed there. */


/* ── CustomerInformationPanelBody ──
   Body content for the "Customer Information" `InteriorPanel` docked right
   of an active interaction — a profile block (avatar initials + name +
   presence),
   two placeholder tab sections, and a detail-row list, reproducing the
   reference mockup's layout as placeholder content (real per-tab data isn't
   wired up yet, same "prototype the shape first" status as the transcript
   above).

   The mockup's field rows (label left, value right, hairline divider) are
   lyra-ui's own documented "Label Horizontal With Separator" composition
   (see Input.stories.tsx) — `Label` (not a plain span) + a value span
   (`lyra-body-md text-lyra-fg-secondary`) + `Separator`, not literally the
   `Input` component itself (Input's own `readonly` mode still renders a
   bordered box, which isn't this shape at all — the horizontal/label-only
   look lives in this separate story pattern, composed from `Label` +
   `Separator`, both already lyra-ui exports). Avatar uses initials
   (`initialsFor`, already used everywhere else in this file) instead of
   the mockup's photo — no photo source exists for these interactions. */

 *  panel (`CustomerHistorySessionDetailPanel`, rendered as a sibling at the
 *  call site) is open; clicking the already-open card's own row toggles it
 *  back closed instead of just re-selecting the same one, same convention
 *  `CustomersListView`'s own `onRowClick` uses for `CustomerRowInfoPanel`.
 *
 *  Scrolls in its OWN independent box (`flex-1 min-h-0 overflow-hidden`
 *  below, with the list itself `overflow-y-auto`) — not as part of the
 *  Customer Information panel's shared `PanelContent` scroll region.
 *  Briefly changed to the latter (single shared scroll + a `sticky`
 *  toolbar) while chasing what turned out to be a real bug one level up —
 *  `SidePanel`'s own docked/pinned branch was missing an `h-full` its
 *  full-screen branch already had, so nothing above this component ever
 *  had a genuinely definite height to bound against, no matter how this
 *  component itself was built. With that fixed at its actual source (see
 *  `CustomerInformationPanelBody`'s own outer wrapper comment), the
 *  original independent-scroll design works as intended again, and is
 *  worth keeping over the shared-scroll fallback: it's what lets
 *  `CustomerHistorySessionDetailPanel` (rendered as this component's own
 *  sibling at the call site) overlay ON TOP of this list instead of
 *  pushing it down or inheriting an arbitrary, content-driven height that
 *  doesn't match the visible viewport.
 *
 *  Search/filter state is local (`useState` in here), not lifted to
 *  `AgentNextGenPage` — unlike `selectedIndex` (which has to survive this
 *  component unmounting, since the detail panel renders as its sibling),
 *  nothing outside this component ever needs to read or restore the
 *  toolbar's own state, so there's no reason to hoist it. `selectedIndex`
 *  itself always refers to a position in the full, unfiltered `entries`
 *  array (so `CustomerHistorySessionDetailPanel`'s prev/next chevrons keep
 *  stepping through the customer's whole history, not just whatever's
 *  currently visible under a filter) — the filtered rows below are mapped

/* ── CustomerDetailTabContent ──
   The "Detail" tab's field-editor form (per a reference screenshot of a
   legacy admin contact-edit page) — two collapsible `Accordion` sections,
   "General" and "Address", both open by default, each a responsive
   `.lyra-form-grid` of real lyra-ui field components (`Input`/`Select`/
   `Checkbox`/`DatePicker`), same "Accordion wrapping real editable fields"
   composition `FormTemplate`'s own "Placement Information" section already
   demonstrates (form-template.tsx) — not a hand-rolled bordered box imitating
   one. `lyra-form-grid-wrap` on the root establishes the container-query
   boundary `.lyra-form-grid` needs (see that class's own doc comment in
   lyra-tokens.css): each row is 2-up at this component's own full width,
   stepping down to a single column well before an `InteriorPanel`'s
   typical ~250–425px width would otherwise crowd two fields onto one line.

   Reference screenshot's field labels were all-caps ("CONTACT #", "FIRST
   NAME") — that's the *legacy* admin app's own styling, not something to
   replicate via CSS `text-transform` (CONTRIBUTING.md §17 already covers
   exactly this mistake). Labels here are typed in normal case and rendered
   through each field component's own built-in label, same as every other
   field in this panel/app.

   Fields with a real source reuse it instead of inventing a second,
   possibly-disagreeing value: "Contact #"/"Total Balance"/"Address
   1"/"City"/"State"/"Zip Code" come straight from `fields` (the same
   per-customer data `buildCustomerInfoFields` already computed for the
   Overview tab — see `getFieldValue` above), and "First Name"/"Last Name"
   are seeded from `customerName` the same way `buildCustomerInfoFields`'s
   own synthesized email does (`splitCustomerName`) — done once, at draft-
   build time (`buildCustomerRecordDraft` below), not derived fresh every
   render here. Everything else in the reference screenshot (Original
   Contact #, Title, Department, Balance Due, Account Block, Group, Due
   Date, Address 2) has no real or synthesized source anywhere in this
   app's data, so those stay at the screenshot's own shown defaults (empty
   / "None" / unchecked-false where shown, "$0.00" for Balance Due
   specifically since it's a distinct "amount currently owed" concept from
   Total Balance, not just a repeat of it).

   Every editable field here is now CONTROLLED via `draft`/`onDraftChange`
   (a `CustomerRecordDraft` + patch-merge setter, both owned by
   `useCustomerRecordDraft` — see that hook's own doc comment) rather than
   this component's own local `useState` per field, per explicit request
   for a Save/Cancel footer: this component used to unmount (losing all
   its local state) the moment the agent switched away from the Detail tab
   (see the `activeTab === ... &&` conditional render in
   `CustomerInformationPanelBody`), which made "pending, revertible edits
   that survive a tab switch" impossible without lifting the values out of
   here first. Still "not wired to persistence" in the sense that matters
   for a prototype (no backend call on Save) — just no longer "silently
   discarded on tab switch" either. */

/* ── CustomerDirectoryPhoneRow ──
   One phone slot's worth of fields, its own little self-contained block —
   pulled out of `CustomerDirectoryTabContent` (rather than inlined in a
   `.map`) so each of the up to 10 rows below owns independent `useState`
   the normal way a component does, instead of ten parallel array-indexed
   state slots in the parent needing hand-rolled per-index update
   functions for every field. Same "Call Attempts Today/Total" read-only
   stat pair for every row (there's no live call-attempt tracking in this
   demo, same static-`0` status as `Thread.messageCount`
   elsewhere) — plain text, not `Metric`/`DashboardCardMetric`, since those
   render a large headline figure + caption meant for a dashboard card,
   not a compact inline stat under a phone field.

   Each slot is its own single-item `Accordion` (title = the slot label,
   e.g. "Home"/"Phone 2") — collapsible per request, `defaultValue={label}`
   so every slot still starts open (same "collapsible but open by default"
   convention as the Overview tab's own "Latest Interaction" accordion).
   `PhoneInput` no longer gets its own `label` prop: the accordion's own
   trigger already shows the slot name as its title immediately above the
   field, so a second, identical label directly under it was pure
   duplication (confirmed from a screenshot of the pre-accordion layout —
   "Home" as a plain heading, then "Home" again as the phone field's own
   label right below it).

   No divider of its own on this row — `Accordion`'s own per-item
   `border-b` (accordion.tsx, rendered after every item's content)
   supplies the hairline between consecutive slots; `CustomerDirectory
   TabContent` adds one `border-t` above the whole list of rows for the
   divider separating it from the Email/Consent block, rather than every
   row duplicating that same top border (which used to visually double up
   with the row-before's own bottom divider).

   Controlled via `state`/`onChange` (a patch-merge setter into this
   slot's own `CustomerDirectoryPhoneState`) rather than its own local
   `useState` seeded from a `defaultState` prop — same "lifted into
   `useCustomerRecordDraft`, survives a tab switch, drives the Save/Cancel
   footer" reasoning `CustomerDetailTabContent`'s own doc comment covers,
   just per-phone-slot instead of per-field. */

/* ── CustomerDirectoryTabContent ──
   The "Directory" tab (per a reference screenshot of a legacy admin
   contact-edit page): an `EmailInput` + a standalone consent `Checkbox` at
   the top, then up to 10 phone slots (`CustomerDirectoryPhoneRow`),
   separated by a hairline divider between every section
   (`border-lyra-border-subtle`). The reference screenshot's own
   alternating shaded/unshaded rows were dropped on request — plain
   dividers only, no zebra striping.

   Reference screenshot's own field labels were all-caps ("EMAIL", "HOME") —
   same legacy-app-styling situation as the Detail tab's "CONTACT #" etc.
   (see `CustomerDetailTabContent`'s own doc comment and CONTRIBUTING.md
   §17): typed in normal case here and left to each field component's own
   built-in label typography, not forced uppercase via CSS.

   Only the "Home" row (the first phone slot) seeds from real data — the
   same `fields` "Phone #" this panel's Overview/Detail tabs already show
   (parsed back into a `PhoneValue` via `phoneValueFromDisplay`), with
   `consentCall`/`consentSms` defaulted true since it's the customer's
   already-established primary channel. "Phone 2" through "Phone 10" have
   no real or synthesized source (a customer doesn't have 10 real numbers
   in this app's data), so they start genuinely blank/unconsented, same as
   the reference screenshot shows them — see `buildCustomerRecordDraft`,
   which now owns seeding this same starting shape.

   Controlled via `draft`/`onDraftChange`/`onPhoneChange` (all three from
   `useCustomerRecordDraft`) rather than its own local `useState` — same
   "lifted so it survives a tab switch and can drive the Save/Cancel
   footer" reasoning as `CustomerDetailTabContent`'s own doc comment. */

/* ── Customer record draft (Detail/Directory Save/Cancel) ──
   Per explicit request: a Save/Cancel footer that animates into the
   bottom of the Customer Information panel whenever the Detail tab's
   fields or the Directory tab's email/consent/phone slots are edited,
   with Cancel reverting every pending edit. Before this, every one of
   those fields was its own local, uncontrolled `useState` inside
   `CustomerDetailTabContent`/`CustomerDirectoryTabContent`/
   `CustomerDirectoryPhoneRow` — which had two problems for this feature:
   (1) there was nowhere to observe "has anything changed" from outside
   those components, and (2) since the Detail/Directory tabs are only
   rendered while active (`activeTab === ... &&`, see
   `CustomerInformationPanelBody`), switching to a different tab UNMOUNTS
   them, silently discarding whatever was locally typed — no baseline to
   even revert TO. `CustomerRecordDraft` below is the whole editable
   surface lifted into one plain object; `useCustomerRecordDraft` owns it
   plus a separately-tracked saved baseline, so edits now survive tab
   switches and Cancel has something real to restore.

   `overviewFields` (added per a later explicit request) extends this same
   draft to also cover the Overview tab's own "Customer Overview" field
   list (Phone #/Contact #/Email/Balance/Address/City/State/Zip Code) —
   previously plain read-only display rows sourced straight from `fields`
   (`buildCustomerInfoFields`'s own synthesized output), with no edit
   affordance at all. A copy of `fields` at draft-build time, not `fields`
   itself: `fields` stays the immutable synthesized "as if freshly loaded"
   baseline the draft is SEEDED from (and what a Cancel effectively
   reverts back toward, via `savedDraft`), while `overviewFields` is the
   editable, saveable copy. `CustomerDetailTabContent`'s own read-only
   duplicates of some of these same values (Contact #/Total Balance/
   Address 1/City/State/Zip Code) now also read from THIS copy — see that
   component's own render call site — so a saved Overview edit doesn't go

/** Copilot tab content — per explicit request, shown whenever the panel's
 *  "Copilot" tab is active: a plain info box giving the agent a one-line
 *  reason the customer is reaching out, plus a "Journey Summary" card
 *  recapping what's led up to this contact. Both pulled from
 *  `buildCopilotSummary` (synthesized, same deterministic-per-customer
 *  approach as Overview's Latest Interaction/Latest Note — see that
 *  function's own doc comment). Purely a read-only recap — the actual
 *  "ask copilot something" affordance is the shared `AIInput` component
 *  (ai-input.tsx) — same component the Overview tab's own footer uses —
 *  pinned to the bottom of this same tab by its caller, not rendered
 *  inline here (see `CustomerInformationSidePanel`'s `footer` prop).
 *
 *  Per explicit follow-up request ("animate in the content in copilot
 *  sequentially after the copilot window opens"), the two blocks below
 *  reveal one after another rather than popping in together: each gets the
 *  same `animate-in fade-in-0 slide-in-from-bottom-1` entrance
 *  `CustomerRecordSaveFooter` above already established for this codebase,
 *  staggered via `tailwindcss-animate`'s `delay-*` utilities (a plain
 *  Tailwind `transitionDelay` scale that plugin also wires up as
 *  `animation-delay` for anything under `animate-in` — no custom CSS
 *  needed). This works as an "on open" reveal with no extra JS/state
 *  because `CopilotTabContent` is only ever mounted while the Copilot tab
 *  is actually active (see this component's call site's `activeTab ===
 *  ...&&` guard) — every fresh mount (tab opened, or landed on directly —
 *  see `copilotAvailable`'s own doc comment on the two places that now
 *  default straight to this tab) is a brand new entrance for the CSS
 *  animation classes to replay, with nothing to reset between opens.
 *
 *  `fill-mode-backwards` on both blocks fixes a flash reported live: by
 *  default `animate-in`'s `animation-fill-mode` is `none`, so during a
 *  `delay-*` (and even the split-second before a non-delayed animation's
 *  first frame paints) the browser renders the element in its plain,
 *  fully-visible resting state — THEN, once the animation actually starts,
 *  it jumps straight to the "from" keyframe (invisible/offset) before
 *  animating back to visible. That "briefly fully visible → sudden
 *  disappear → fade back in" sequence is what read as a flash, worst on the
 *  Journey Summary card since its whole `delay-300` window was spent fully
 *  visible first. `fill-mode-backwards` makes the element hold the "from"
 *  keyframe's styles for the ENTIRE time before its animation starts too,
 *  so both blocks stay invisible from first paint straight through their
 *  delay, with nothing to visually pop before the intended reveal.
 *  `duration-500`/`delay-300` (up from the original `duration-300`/
 *  `delay-150`) per the same follow-up request to slow the pacing down —
 *  a more clearly readable half-second fade+slide each, with a noticeable
 *  pause between the two rather than a rushed back-to-back flicker.
 *
 *  `extra` (per explicit follow-up request — the Marcus Webb scripted
 *  scenario, `AgentWorkspace2WithDeskPage.tsx`) renders BELOW the Journey
 *  Summary card, third in the same staggered reveal (`delay-500`) — a
 *  generic escape hatch rather than any Marcus-specific markup living in
 *  this shared component: that page builds its own decision/steps/wrap-up
 *  cards entirely on its own and just hands the finished `ReactNode` down
 *  through `CustomerInformationPanelBody`/`CustomerInformationSidePanel`'s
 *  own same-named prop. `undefined` for every other caller/interaction —
 *  nothing renders here normally. */

          unconditional like this) both failed live — but the actual root
          cause turned out to be one level up, not here: `SidePanel`'s own
          pinned/docked branch (side-panel.tsx) was missing the `h-full`
          its unpinned/full-screen branch already had, so `PanelContent`
          above this wrapper never reliably had a DEFINITE height to give
          it in docked mode specifically (confirmed by the exact symptom
          reported: full-screen scrolled fine, docked didn't — full-screen
          reaches its height a completely different way, `position:
          absolute` against `Container`'s own unambiguous flex-grow height,
          which was never affected by the bug). With that fixed at its
          actual source, this wrapper's own `h-full` now resolves correctly
          again — every tab gets a real box matching `PanelContent`'s
          available height (harmless for Overview/Detail/etc., which just
          overflow it normally with no clipping, same as always), and the
          Contacts tab below gets a genuinely bounded box to build its
          own internal list-scroll + overlaying detail panel on top of. */}
      {/* No avatar/name/presence block here — the InteriorPanel's own
          header (`headerTitle="Customer Information"` +
          `headerSubhead="{name} · {id}"`) already shows the name, so a
          second name+avatar block right below it was redundant.

          No tabs here either anymore — they used to live at the top of
          this same scrolling body, pinned via a hand-rolled `sticky`
          wrapper (see the git history / CONTRIBUTING.md's "Composing
          panel body content" for the full story of why that was wrong:
          the surrounding scroll container's own scrollbar still ran
          alongside a merely-`sticky` row, and `TabList`'s "N More"
          overflow menu had its own separate bug where selecting a tab
          from it silently did nothing once the row collapsed, fixed in
          tabs.tsx). They now render inside the header itself via
          `SidePanel`'s `headerTabs` prop — see
          `CustomerInformationSidePanel` below, which owns the
          `activeTab` state both this body and that header tab row need
          and passes this component just the number.

          This field list and the Customer Overview/Latest Interaction/
          Latest Note block below it are now both explicitly gated to the
          Overview tab (`activeTab === ...indexOf("Overview")`) —
          previously only the accordions had that gate, so this list
          rendered on every tab, including the new Detail tab added below,
          which shows its own full editable version of the same fields
          (`CustomerDetailTabContent`) and would otherwise show them twice.

          Layout (per explicit follow-up request): Customer Overview is now
          its own full-width row on top; Latest Interaction and Latest Note
          share one `.lyra-card-split-wrap`/`.lyra-card-split` row below it
          (see lyra-tokens.css) — reusing the same family `DashboardCard`
          bodies already use for "a couple of regions side by side,
          stacking once the container's own width gets tight" rather than
          inventing a new one (its ≤480px threshold already fits here on
          both ends: this panel's normal resizable range, ~350–425px per
          `InteriorPanel`'s own min/max defaults, stays comfortably under
          it — single column, unchanged from before this existed — and
          `allowFullScreen`'d width is easily past it — side by side).
          (Earlier arrangement, superseded here: Latest Interaction paired
          with Customer Overview in the split row, Latest Note full-width
          below both — moved per this follow-up request so Latest
          Interaction sits directly left of Latest Note instead.)

          Top/bottom order (both row and stacked state) falls straight out
          of plain DOM order — flexbox doesn't reverse either axis without
          an explicit `row-reverse`/`column-reverse`, so whichever child
          comes FIRST in the JSX is the TOP block regardless of state here
          (Customer Overview, full width, has no row-state sibling to sit
          left/right of). `align-items: stretch` (the split family's own
          default) is harmless here specifically because `Accordion`'s own
          root has no `h-full`/`flex-1` of its own (accordion.tsx) — a
          stretched flex item just leaves invisible empty space below its
          natural-height content, not a visibly over-tall bordered box.

          Unlike `.lyra-container-grid`/`.lyra-form-grid`, `.lyra-card-
          split` does NOT put `flex: 1 1 0%` on its children automatically
          — that family's own two optional modifiers (`.lyra-card-split-
          fixed`, a deliberately fixed 12rem column; `.lyra-card-split-
          chart`, `flex: 1 1 0%` for the region beside it) exist precisely
          because its usual pairing is one fixed-width region next to one
          flexible one, not two equal columns. Left as plain children, the
          two `Accordion`s took their own natural content width instead,
          rendering visibly unequal (each has its own different content
          length). The `.lyra-card-split-even` modifier (lyra-tokens.css)
          on both fixes that, splitting the row evenly (and correctly
          resetting back to full-width at the stacked stage, same as
          `.lyra-container-grid`/`.lyra-form-grid`'s own children — see
          that modifier's own doc comment for why a bare `flex-1` utility
          class alone isn't enough here).

          Gap consistency (per explicit request — rows and columns both
          16px): the outer `flex flex-col gap-4` below already puts 16px
          between Customer Overview and the split row. `.lyra-card-split`'s
          own shared rule (lyra-tokens.css) defaults to `gap: 1.5rem`
          (24px) — correct for its other consumers, but inconsistent with
          this 16px if left alone. Overridden here via an inline `style`
          (not a Tailwind class) specifically because `.lyra-card-split`'s
          `gap` comes from a plain CSS class, not a Tailwind utility —
          `cn()`/`tailwind-merge` only dedupes genuine Tailwind utility
          conflicts, so a `gap-4` class alongside `lyra-card-split` would
          just tie in specificity with it and depend on stylesheet source
          order to win, the exact fragility CONTRIBUTING.md already warns
          about elsewhere in this file. An inline style has no such
          ambiguity — it always wins. Applies identically whether the row
          is side-by-side or (≤480px) stacked to a column, since inline
          styles aren't scoped to a breakpoint the way the shared class's
          own `@container` rule is — 16px either way, matching the 16px
          above it. */}

              Latest Interaction and Latest Note were side-by-side beneath

              column Latest Interaction/Latest Note row already used for "a
              couple of regions side by side, stacking once the container's
              own width gets tight" (see that modifier's own doc comment in
              lyra-tokens.css) — just with two DIFFERENT regions as the
              row's two children now: this Accordion on the left, and the
              new stacked wrapper below on the right, rather than each half
              being one Accordion the way the old row was. Its ≤480px
              stacking threshold still fits here: at the panel's normal
              resizable width (~325–425px) it stacks to a column (Customer
              Overview on top, matching the old top-to-bottom reading order),
              and `allowFullScreen`'d width stays comfortably side by side. */}

                  container (`bg-lyra-bg-control-subtle`, rounded) per
                  CONTRIBUTING.md's "Composing panel body content"
                  convention, rather than sitting flush against the panel
                  background — the convention to follow for any future
                  card-like block added here, not a one-off choice for this
                  block alone. Collapsible via lyra-ui's `Accordion` (single
                  item, open by default) rather than a plain static block,
                  so the panel can be collapsed once read.

                  Height-matching now goes BOTH ways, per explicit follow-up
                  request — this used to stay unconditionally `h-fit` (its
                  own natural content height, from `CUSTOMER_INFO_ACCORDION_
                  CLASSNAME`) on the assumption its own field list was
                  reliably the taller side, with only the stacked column on
                  the right ever growing to match it. That assumption broke
                  once "View All Contacts" made the right column taller
                  for some customers — so this now clears `h-fit` to
                  `h-auto` (via `customerOverviewOpen`, controlled the same
                  way `latestNoteOpen` is — see that state's own comment)
                  whenever it's open, letting the row's own default
                  `align-items: stretch` size it to match whichever side is
                  actually taller, same mechanism the stacked wrapper below
                  already relied on for the other direction. Stays `h-fit`
                  while collapsed (same reasoning `latestNoteOpen`'s own gate
                  documents) so collapsing this card doesn't leave it
                  stretched into a tall box with a dead gap below its closed
                  header row. */}

                  own `customerOverviewOpen`/Latest Note's own
                  `latestNoteOpen` gates — see each Accordion's own comment).
                  While open, the row's cross size is simply the max of the
                  two sides' natural content heights, and BOTH sides now grow
                  to match it (Customer Overview via the row's cross axis

                  Note's `flex-1` below) — so whichever side is actually
                  taller for a given customer, the other one grows to match
                  it, not just one fixed "always taller" side. That alone
                  only gets the outer wrapper box to the right total height,
                  though — a plain `flex-col` of two natural-height
                  Accordions doesn't automatically grow its own children to
                  fill that extra space, so without more, the wrapper would
                  just end in blank unbordered space below Latest Note
                  instead of the two columns visually lining up (confirmed
                  live — this was the very next thing reported). Latest
                  Note's own `flex-1` (see that Accordion's own comment
                  below) is what actually closes that gap, growing ITS
                  bordered box to absorb the leftover height so the stack's
                  own bottom edge lines up with Customer Overview's — same
                  "stretch a card's own box to fill available height, even
                  past its natural content" mechanism this file's own
                  `bothCardsOpen`/`h-auto` used for the two cards' old
                  side-by-side row, just applied to one trailing card in a
                  column instead of two peer cards in a row. */}

                {/* Its trigger renders the "Latest Interaction" title
                    itself — no hand-styled label needed here at all, which
                    also fixes an earlier mistake: that label used to be a
                    hand-built `uppercase tracking-wide` span, applying an
                    all-caps CSS transform to change how it displayed
                    instead of just typing it correctly — exactly the thing
                    CONTRIBUTING.md §17 ("Field label casing") says not to
                    do ("don't add `text-transform`; type the label text
                    correctly to begin with"). Typing the string as
                    `"Latest Interaction"` (already correct Title Case) and
                    letting the shared component's own typography render it
                    is the fix, not restyling it further.

                    Content itself comes from `latestInteraction` (built by
                    `buildLatestInteraction`) rather than one fixed
                    placeholder blurb — see that function's own doc comment
                    for why (it used to be the exact same "Asked about
                    upgrading her plan..." summary for every customer,
                    gendered pronoun and all, regardless of who was actually
                    open).

                    Status used to render as its own pill `Badge` sitting to
                    the right of the timestamp line — reverted per explicit
                    request (a filled pill there read as too visually loud/
                    noticeable). Now a plain second line directly below the
                    timestamp: a small circle `Badge` dot (`shape="circle"
                    dot"`, colored via `statusVariant` the same semantic-role
                    vocabulary `ContactHistoryStatusVariant`/Contact
                    History's own status dots already use) plus the status
                    name as plain text next to it — quieter than a filled
                    pill, same "dot + label" idiom already established
                    elsewhere in this file. */}

                    `buildLatestNote` the same deterministic-per-customer
                    way. No status `Badge` here — notes don't carry a

                    height (from the split row's `align-items: stretch`,
                    see the wrapper's own comment above) show up as a real,
                    visibly-taller bordered box instead of invisible space

                    Latest Interaction above it, so the trailing card in the
                    stack is the one that absorbs the leftover height,
                    matching Customer Overview's own bottom edge. `h-auto`

                    old side-by-side row (see that history for the full
                    "h-fit silently overriding stretch" explanation) — this
                    is a flex-COLUMN growing on the main axis (height) this
                    time rather than a flex-ROW stretching on the cross axis,
                    but an explicit `h-fit` risks the same kind of fight
                    with the flex algorithm either way, so it's cleared here
                    too rather than assumed harmless. */}

 *  data and the same `CUSTOMER_PANEL_TABS` tab set, even the same
 *  Overview-tab `AIInput` footer — inside a `Popover` when the agent
 *  hovers the record header's toggle icon while the real panel is closed
 *  (see the render site further down). A hover-preview flyout of the panel
 *  itself, per explicit request, not a separate hand-built summary — this
 *  can never show something different from what actually opening the panel
 *  would. Same idea as `InteractionNavItem`'s own compact-rail hover
 *  preview (interaction-nav-item.tsx: "think of how you display your left
 *  nav when it's closed"), which shows that card's full real content
 *  (`cardBody`) inside a bare, self-chromed `Popover` rather than a
 *  simplified stand-in — this component supplies that same complete chrome
 *  itself (border/background/shadow/rounded corners, matching `SidePanel`'s
 *  own `bg-lyra-bg-surface-container-subtle` — side-panel.tsx) since the
 *  render site strips the default `Popover` framing to a bare frame around
 *  it, exactly like that same precedent.
 *
 *  Sized to actually fit as a flyout (fixed `w-[340px]`, matching this
 *  panel's own default docked width, `max-h-[70vh]` with only the body
 *  scrolling) rather than the real panel's full docked/full-screen height —
 *  the header (title/subhead + tabs) stays pinned via `PanelHeader`'s own
 *  `tabs` prop, same fixed-header/scrolling-body split `SidePanel` itself
 *  uses, so a tall tab's content scrolls internally instead of pushing the
 *  popover off-screen. Owns its own `activeTab` state (starts on Overview),
 *  independent of the real panel's own — switching tabs in this preview
 *  doesn't affect, and isn't affected by, whatever tab the agent last left
 *  the real panel on.
 *
 *  `onMouseEnter`/`onMouseLeave` are wired by the caller to the exact same
 *  open-immediately/close-on-a-short-delay handlers as the trigger icon
 *  itself — Radix `Popover.Content` portals straight to `document.body`,
 *  outside the trigger icon's own DOM subtree, so without re-arming here
 *  too, moving the pointer from the icon into this (portaled) popover would
 *  fire the icon's own `onMouseLeave` and close the preview before the

   the view of the user"), Save/Cancel need to render in the CALLER's own

   pinned/visible at every scroll position) rather than inline at the
   bottom of the scrolling form the way they used to — a plain component
   returning one render tree has no way to split itself across two
   different slots on an element it doesn't own. Returning `{ body, footer
   }` as plain values lets the caller spread `footer` into its existing
   `SidePanel` call's own `footer` prop (only while THIS tab is showing —
   see each page's own render site) and `body` into that tab's content,
   exactly like `useCustomerDetailsInteriorPanel` already does one level up

   information — instead of opening the side panel, take the content in the
   customer information side panel and load it in the interior panel with a
   back arrow to the left of the customer name, the content should take
   over the entire interior panel and allow it to expand full screen"): the
   SAME tabbed content `CustomerInformationSidePanel` shows (Overview/
   Detail/Notes/etc. via `CustomerInformationPanelBody`), reused here so it
   can be swapped into the "Details" `InteriorPanel` (see each page file's
   own render site — the same panel that shows `DetailsPanelAccordions`)
   instead of opening the separate docked side panel.

   Deliberately a HOOK, not a component that renders its own `InteriorPanel`
   (unlike `CustomerRowInfoPanel`, which owns a whole panel of its own):
   this content lives inside an `InteriorPanel` the CALLER already renders
   for a different reason (the "Details" panel, shared with
   `DetailsPanelAccordions`), so `headerTabs` needs to reach that panel's
   own `headerTabs` prop (kept OUT of the scrolling body, same as every
   other tabbed panel in this file) while `body` reaches its `children` and
   `footer` its `footer` — three separate slots on one already-existing
   element the caller owns, not something this hook can return as a single
   render tree of its own. Returning them as plain values lets the caller
   just spread them into its existing `InteriorPanel` call's props
   (`headerIcon`/`headerTitle`/`headerSubhead`/`headerTabs`/`footer`/
   `children`, swapped in only while this view is showing).

   `recordDraft`/`overviewEditing`/`onOverviewEditingChange`/`onAddToast`/
   `onStartInteraction`/`onOpenHistoryConversation` are all the SAME lifted
   page-level state/handlers the real `CustomerInformationSidePanel`
   instance already takes (see that component's own doc comments) — passed
   straight through here too so an edit started in one view (this one, the
   docked side panel, or the record-header hover preview) shows up
   consistently in the others, exactly like today. `tabs`/`channels`/
   `recordId`/`customerName` are the same per-caller values already passed
   to that same side panel instance.

   `activeTab` resets to "Overview" only when `recordId` itself changes
   (a genuinely different customer) — not on `onBack`/reopen, matching
   `CustomerInformationSidePanel`'s own behavior (a `SidePanel` that's just
   hidden via `open`, not remounted, so its last-viewed tab persists across
   a close/reopen too). */

/* ── CustomerInformationSidePanel ──
   Owns `activeTab` — the one piece of state both the header's `TabList`
   (via `SidePanel`'s `headerTabs`) and the scrolling body below it
   (`CustomerInformationPanelBody`) need, which is why this wraps both
   instead of `CustomerInformationPanelBody` owning that state itself the
   way it used to when the tabs still lived inside it.

   Also where the field list and Latest Interaction summary are actually
   computed (`buildCustomerInfoFields`/`buildLatestInteraction`, each
   memoized on `customerName`/`recordId`/`channels`) — takes the raw
   interaction fields instead of a pre-joined `headerSubhead` string so it
   has what it needs to build the header text and both panel-body pieces
   from the same source, rather than the caller assembling one string this
   component has to parse back apart.

   Docked via the generic `SidePanel` primitive (originally LEFT, matching
   an early reference screenshot; now RIGHT — `side="right"` below — per a
   later explicit request to move it, alongside the render site's own move
   to the row's other end) rather than the right-docked `InteriorPanel` this
   was previously built on — pin/hover-preview state lives in the parent
   (mirrors `AgentNextGenTemplate.stories.tsx`'s own `CustomerInformation-
   Panel` usage), since that's a `SidePanel`-only concept `InteriorPanel`
   never had. `allowFullScreen`/`exitFullScreenSignal`/`onOverlayModeChange`
   don't carry over — `SidePanel` has no "full screen" or "floating
   overlay" concept of its own; an unpinned panel simply shows/hides on
   hover instead.

   Full-screen (per explicit follow-up request) is built entirely here,
   without adding a real "full screen" concept to `SidePanel` itself: the
   caller passes `pinned={false}` (always an unpinned/floating overlay
   while full-screen — pushing the main column over via docked/pinned mode
   wouldn't read as "overlay full screen within its parent container") and
   `width` equal to the parent `Container`'s own measured width
   (`sidePanelContainerWidth`, already tracked for the narrow-container
   guard) instead of the normal drag-resized width, so the panel's own
   existing unpinned/absolute rendering branch (side-panel.tsx) covers the
   whole container edge to edge — animated by the same CSS width
   transition every other resize already uses, so expanding/collapsing
   full-screen isn't an instant jump cut. That animation needed one small
   fix in the shared `usePanelDragResize` hook (use-panel-drag-resize.ts):
   it used to latch onto whatever width a manual drag last set and ignore
   further external `width` prop changes afterward, which (a) silently
   broke this full-screen toggle for a panel that had been manually
   resized even once before, and (b) meant this component used to have to
   force a full remount on every full-screen toggle just to reset that
   stale internal state, which skipped the transition entirely (a fresh
   DOM node has no prior frame to animate from). The hook now resets its
   own internal drag state whenever its `initialWidth` prop changes, so it
   stays properly reactive to external width changes and no remount is
   needed here anymore. */

   `buildCustomerInfoFields`/`buildLatestInteraction`/`buildLatestNote`
   helpers that feed it) `CustomerInformationSidePanel` already shows for an
   active interaction, rather than a second hand-built copy of that same
   Overview/Detail/Directory content. Two real differences from that
   component, both per explicit request: docked RIGHT via `InteriorPanel`
   (that one is left-docked via `SidePanel`, for an unrelated reason — see
   its own doc comment), and no `AIInput` at all — this panel is read-only
   reference info about whichever customer row was clicked, not the seat
   of an active conversation to ask the AI assistant about. It DOES now
   get its own `footer`, though (per a later explicit request): the same
   Save/Cancel footer `CustomerInformationSidePanel` shows for pending
   Detail/Directory edits — see `useCustomerRecordDraft`'s own doc
   comment. "Read-only reference info" described the panel's own identity
   fields (never editable, no AI assistant), not the Detail/Directory
   forms nested inside it, which were always editable here too.

   `channels: []` passed to `buildCustomerInfoFields` below — that param
   only exists so a real *active* interaction's actually-open voice/email
   channel can override the synthesized phone/email fallback (see that
   function's own doc comment); a Customers-table row was never opened as

/* ── CustomerFullScreenTabContent ──
   Per explicit request ("in agent workspace 2.0 premium, when an agent
   clicks the Full Screen [button on `CustomerRowInfoPanel`], instead of
   toggling to a full screen mode, open a new tab... put it to the far right
   of the tabs in the home screen container"): the content of one such
   desk-level tab — a customer's full profile (Overview/Detail/Notes/etc.,
   the exact same `CustomerInformationPanelBody` every other consumer of
   this file renders), stretched across the full desk-tab content column
   instead of docked/floating beside the Customers table.

   Deliberately NOT built by reusing `CustomerRowInfoPanel` (above) with
   `InteriorPanel`'s own `isFullScreen` state forced permanently on:
   `isFullScreen` is genuinely internal/uncontrolled state inside
   `InteriorPanel` (no prop exists to force it on from outside — see that
   component's own doc comment on `allowFullScreen`), and `InteriorPanel`
   itself is fundamentally a FLYOUT (open/close slide animation, drag-resize
   handle, docked-vs-overlay positioning) — repurposing it to sit
   permanently inline as an ordinary block would mean fighting all of that
   machinery rather than using it. Instead, this composes the same lower-
   level pieces `InteriorPanel` itself is built from — `PanelHeader` (=
   `ContainerHeader`), `PanelContent`, `PanelFooter` — directly, exactly the
   same way `CustomerRowInfoPanel` and `CustomerInformationSidePanel` both
   already do internally (see interior-panel.tsx / side-panel.tsx) — so this
   renders pixel-identical chrome (title/subhead row, tab strip, scrollable
   body, Save/Cancel footer) with none of the flyout-only behavior this
   context doesn't need.

   Owns its own `activeTab`/`recordDraft`/`overviewEditing` state (same
   shape `CustomerRowInfoPanel` keeps for its own instance) rather than
   sharing state with whichever `CustomerRowInfoPanel` row might currently
   be open on the Customers tab — the two are genuinely independent views
   once this tab exists (the docked panel can be closed, or moved to a
   different row, without disturbing this tab's own content), matching how
   the caller keeps every open customer tab mounted independently (see
   `openCustomerTabs`'s own doc comment, AgentWorkspace2WithDeskPage.tsx).

   No `onClose`/header X button — closing happens via the desk tab's own
   trailing remove control (the same `Tab` `onRemove` affordance every other
   removable tab in this app already uses), not a second close control
   duplicated inside the content itself. No prev/next chevrons either
   (`CustomerRowInfoPanel`'s own, for stepping through the Customers
   table's current sort order) — those are specific to that docked-panel
   workflow; this tab is anchored to one specific customer, not a walkable
   position in a list. */

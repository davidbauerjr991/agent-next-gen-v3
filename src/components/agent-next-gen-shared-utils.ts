   Split out of AgentNextGenPage.tsx (which had grown past Babel's 500KB
   code-generator threshold — see that file's own top-of-file note) so it
   has somewhere to import these from instead of declaring them itself.
   Every function/constant in this file is deliberately "pure" with
   respect to the rest of the app: none of them reference any OTHER
   AgentNextGenPage-specific type, component, or piece of mock data — they
   only take plain values in and return plain values out (or, for a
   handful, reference only each other, e.g. `newCaseNotificationTitle` →
   `channelNoun`, `getAwaitingSeverity` → its own two threshold constants).
   That purity is exactly what makes this file safe to sit at the BASE of
   the dependency graph: `agent-next-gen-outbound-data.ts`,
   `agent-next-gen-customer-info-panel.tsx`, and others all import from
   here, and this file imports from none of them — so there's no risk of
   a circular import no matter how many of those feature files end up
   needing the same small helper (confirmed via a dependency-graph script
   before the split, not just by inspection — see PROJECT_SUMMARY.md's
   "AgentNextGenPage split" entry if this file's own history is ever
   relevant again). */

 *  contact's OWN `email`/`primaryPhone`/synthesized-`@name` WhatsApp handle
 *  to decide whether every address for a channel is already open and the
 *  channel should disable itself. If this function's output ever drifted
 *  from the contact object's own fields, that comparison would silently
 *  never match — exactly the bug this function's `value`-wiring fixes:
 *  confirmed via screenshot that reopening Omar Farooq (a hand-authored
 *  Contact History row, `contactHistoryOutboundContact`) and then clicking
 *  the header's own Email button opened a SECOND, duplicate email channel
 *  instead of disabling itself, because `handleReopenContactHistoryEntry`
 *  only ever set the new channel's `addressLabel` (display only), never its
 *  `value` — the field `buildOpenChannelTagger` actually reads to populate
 *  `openChannelAddresses` in the first place, so that map stayed empty and
 *  nothing ever looked "already open." The `@name` WhatsApp branch below
 *  deliberately does NOT strip spaces from `customerName` for this same
 *  reason — `resolveOutboundDetailField`'s own WhatsApp formula
 *  (`@${contact.name}`) doesn't either, and this needs to produce that
 *  exact same string, not a similar-looking one, or WhatsApp's own
 *  exhaustion check would silently break the same way Email's just did.

 *  chat widget has no phone/email/handle concept anywhere in this app's

 *  not even be identified — showing a fabricated "address" for it would be

 *  (this channel's own start time, formatted the same "h:mm AM/PM" way

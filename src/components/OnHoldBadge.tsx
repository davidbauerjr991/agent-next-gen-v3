/**
 * PROTOTYPE — local to agent-next-gen-v3 only. NOT in lyra-ui yet. See
 * CollapsedChannelBadge.tsx's own doc comment for the same "why local"
 * convention this follows (build new things locally, promote to lyra-ui
 * only once explicitly asked).
 *
 * Depicts an interaction's own live voice call as "on hold" once the agent
 * has navigated away to a different interaction — per explicit request
 * ("if the agent goes to a different interactionNavItem the call controls
 * should go into a hold mode and be depicted as on hold in the
 * interactionNavItem"). Each page derives WHICH interaction this applies to
 * itself (an interaction has a live, not-yet-hung-up voice thread AND isn't
 * the currently active interaction — see each page's own
 * `findLiveVoiceThread` doc comment) and passes that down as
 * `InteractionNavCard`'s own `onHold` prop; this file only owns the two
 * actual renderings, since `InteractionNavItem` (lyra-ui, read-only) has no
 * built-in slot for either.
 *
 * Two renderings because `InteractionNavCard` (each page's own local wrapper
 * around `InteractionNavItem`, not this file) itself renders two
 * structurally different shapes depending on whether the LeftNav rail is
 * expanded:
 *  - `OnHoldCornerBadge` — collapsed (icon-rail) tile: an absolutely-
 *    positioned corner badge, the same "external overlay on a `relative`
 *    wrapper" technique `CollapsedChannelBadge` already uses for that same
 *    tile (that component's own doc comment has the full "why external,
 *    why `relative`" reasoning) — parked at the OPPOSITE corner
 *    (`right-0 top-0`) so it never collides with that badge's `left-0
 *    top-0`.
 *  - `OnHoldPill` — expanded (full detail) card: a small inline pill meant
 *    for `InteractionNavItem`'s own `headerAction` slot (rendered at the
 *    end of the card's header row, next to the customer name) — the only
 *    slot that component exposes for arbitrary extra content there.

/* ── MarcusWebbNextBestActionCard ──
   Per explicit request ("i want the next best action content ... to
   populate like the way claude asks questions ... with a way to add
   something else"): replaces the plain one-sentence "Next Best Action"
   text (`ContactOverview`'s own `nextBestAction` string prop,
   lyra-ui/contact-overview.tsx) for Marcus Webb's refund-escalation
   interaction specifically, via that component's new `nextBestActionContent`
   prop — see that prop's own doc comment for why a rich-content override was
   added there rather than widening `nextBestAction` itself.

   Scoped to Marcus Webb only (per explicit decision) — every other
   interaction keeps the original plain-sentence Next Best Action untouched;
   this component is never rendered for them. The three context bullets
   below are a more detailed expansion of the two already shown in Marcus's
   "Contact Snapshot" accordion just above this one (same call,
   AgentWorkspaceAdvancedPage.tsx `MARCUS_WEBB_ID` branch) — grounded in the
   same scripted facts as `MARCUS_WEBB_CALL_TRANSCRIPT` (order #48213,
   noise-cancelling headphones, cracked ear cup, $200 refund, $100
   auto-approval limit, placed last Tuesday), not invented ones.

   Built from lyra-ui's `RadioGroup`/`RadioGroupItem` (radio.tsx) for real
   radio semantics/keyboard nav — its `label` prop was widened from `string`
   to `React.ReactNode` to allow the stacked title+description block used
   here, rather than hand-rolling a fresh Radix radio group locally (no
   existing lyra-ui component already has this "option card with a
   description" shape to reuse as-is). Each option's own bordered wrapper
   (not part of `RadioGroupItem` itself) reuses the same selected-state
   token pair (`bg-lyra-bg-active-subtle`/`border-lyra-border-active`)
   `ToggleGroup` and the (currently disabled) Marcus decision card in
   `AgentWorkspace2WithDeskPage.tsx` already use for "this option is
   picked," for visual consistency with those existing patterns.

   Per a later explicit follow-up ("we need a button to do the command when
   it's selected kind of like the enter button... in screenshot 2"),
   selecting an option alone is no longer the end of the interaction — an
   inline confirm button (Rule Zero: never a hand-rolled `<button>` —
   `InlineSubmitButton` below, `CornerDownLeft` echoing Claude Code's own
   `AskUserQuestion` "Enter to submit" affordance; originally a ghost
   `ActionIconButton`, later made solid-filled per explicit request — see
   `InlineSubmitButton`'s own doc comment) appears on the currently
   selected row. Confirming locks that choice in (`confirmed`) and
   replaces the option list with a
   static summary of the command that was "issued," plus a `Spinner` +
   elapsed-timer status line simulating the AI agent acting on it — per
   explicit clarification, still no real backend wiring, just a convincing
   completed/in-progress look (same "simulate, don't actually call
   anything" convention this app already uses elsewhere, e.g. the customer
   auto-reply timer). There's no way to reopen/change the answer once
   confirmed — "lock in" was explicit, and this stays intentionally simple.

   Per a later explicit bug report ("it's still hung up" — the performing/
   spinner row never resolved), the simulated action now actually finishes:
   4 real seconds after confirming, `completed` flips true, the elapsed
   timer freezes (its own interval simply stops being recreated — see that
   effect's own guard), and the spinner/status text swap to a finished
   look. Still no real backend call — just a bounded simulated duration
   instead of an indefinite one, same "simulate, don't actually call
   anything" convention as the rest of this card.

   Per a later explicit bug report ("the transcript doesn't appear to have
   updated") — completing the action now DOES have one real, visible
   effect outside this card: `onComplete` (new prop, called once, the same
   moment `completed` flips true) hands the caller a follow-up line for the
   AI agent to "say" back on the call, reflecting whatever was decided.
   This is the one deliberate exception to this card's earlier "no
   callback prop, nothing wired to real interaction state" design — the
   caller (`AgentWorkspaceAdvancedPage.tsx`) appends it to Marcus's own
   scripted `MARCUS_WEBB_CALL_TRANSCRIPT`-seeded `liveMessages`, the same
   mechanism `handleSendMessage` already uses for the composer, so the
   transcript actually shows the call being wrapped up instead of staying
   frozen on "please hold." The message text itself is still just static,
   hand-written copy per option — no real generation involved. Per a
   LATER explicit bug report, "something else" no longer posts anything
   to the transcript via `onComplete` at all: a "something else" note is
   an internal workflow instruction for the AI agent, not something it
   would ever say to the customer on the call, so `somethingElseRounds`'s
   own step effect (below) doesn't call `onComplete` — the note only ever
   shows in-card (the instruction row + its own follow-up bubble).

   Per a later explicit request, "Approve" specifically (not Reject/
   Something else — scoped to just this one option) drops the generic
   `Spinner`+elapsed-timer row for lyra-ui's own `AIProcess` step list
   (ai-process.tsx — already a generic, caller-driven component with no
   timers of its own; this file supplies the `steps`/statuses and drives
   them forward itself, same pattern `App.tsx` already uses it with). Each
   of the three steps completing fires its own named callback
   (`onAgentContactedCustomer`/`onCustomerApprovedResolution`/
   `onDispositionUpdated`) — a second, larger exception to the original
   "no callback prop" design, since these are real effects the caller
   applies to actual interaction state (a transcript message, a status
   change), not just narration. Per a later explicit follow-up, this list
   no longer ends on its own "close/dismiss" step — that's no longer
   simulated as part of Approve at all (`onAssignmentClosed` stays a real
   prop on this card, just for the separate "flag for review" flow's own
   step list instead; see `FLAG_STEP_LABELS`). `confirmed === "approve"`'s own
   render branch and `approveStepIndex`/its effect are entirely separate
   from the `completed`/`elapsedSeconds` machinery above, which now only
   drives Something else.

   Per a later explicit request, Reject grew its own multi-stage flow,
   parallel to (but distinct from) Approve's — it no longer shares the
   generic `completed`/`elapsedSeconds` spinner at all:
   1. The instant Reject is confirmed, a follow-up question appears asking
      the agent WHY — a `Textarea` + the same inline "Enter" confirm
      affordance used for option selection above (`rejectReason`/
      `rejectReasonSubmitted`).
   2. Only once THAT'S submitted does `onComplete` fire, with the same
      `AGENT_REPLY.reject` text as before, posting the rejection note to
      the transcript. Per an explicit correction, this used to fire the
      instant Reject was confirmed — driven off real state instead of a
      blind timer, "do the same thing as Approve," but still notifying
      Marcus before the agent had even said why; now it waits for the
      reason (`rejectionNoteFiredRef` guards it firing more than once).
   3. Submitting the reason also starts a second `AIProcess` step list
      (`REJECT_STEP_LABELS`/`rejectStepIndex`, same shape as Approve's own
      step machinery): the AI agent asks the customer for a photo of the
      damaged item (`onPhotoRequested` — a real transcript line, the AI
      agent actually said this), then waits for their response.

   Per explicit correction, the customer's photo itself never touches the
   transcript at all — it's rendered right here in this card, directly
   below the step list, once both reject steps finish (a small note plus
   lyra-ui's `AttachmentThumbnail`). Clicking it fires `onPhotoExpand`; this
   card doesn't own the expanded/full-screen state itself — the caller
   (`AgentWorkspaceAdvancedPage.tsx`) takes over the MAIN interaction
   column with it, the same "takes over" mechanic the video call window
   already uses, NOT the transcript column (an earlier pass got this
   backwards — the photo briefly lived as a transcript message with an
   image attachment, expanding inside the transcript itself). Per a later
   explicit request, this is now a real photo (`src/assets/headphones.jpg`,
   `AttachmentThumbnail`'s own `src` prop) rather than the generic photo-
   icon-plus-filename placeholder every other mocked attachment in this app
   still uses.

   Per explicit decision, nothing here auto-opens the Outcome popover or
   auto-selects a disposition — "Flagged for Review" was simply added to
   `OUTCOME_DISPOSITION_OPTIONS` (agent-next-gen-transcript.tsx) for the
   human agent to pick themselves once they've seen the photo.

   Per a later explicit request, the photo isn't the end of the Reject
   flow — a SECOND "How would you like to proceed?" question appears right
   below it (`NextBestActionOptionPicker`, extracted once this and the
   top-level question needed the exact same radio+inline-confirm markup),
   with its own three options answered by `handlePhotoDecisionConfirm`:
   - **Approve** appends the approve summary/`AIProcess` (`approveBlock`)
     below everything already on screen, via `approvedAfterReject` — NOT
     `confirmed`, which stays `"reject"` (see the next paragraph for why).
   - **Reject and provide another reason** appends a fresh round
     (`rejectRounds`) rather than resetting the current one.
   - **Something else** locks in its own "flag for review" `AIProcess`
     (`FLAG_STEP_LABELS`/`flagStepIndex`/`flagConfirmed`): flagging the
     account, updating the session status to "Escalated" (a real status
     change, `onStatusEscalated` — same `handleInteractionStatusChange`
     mechanism `onDispositionUpdated` already uses for Approve), then
     dismissing the assignment (reuses `onAssignmentClosed` — dismissing is
     dismissing, regardless of which path got here).

   Per an explicit bug report ("the conversation should continue in line -
   not reset... treat this like an actual claude session"), Approve/Reject
   at this second question used to ERASE the photo and reason history:
   Approve called `setConfirmed("approve")`, which switched the ENTIRE
   render branch away from `"reject"`; Reject reset `rejectReason`/
   `rejectStepIndex` back to their starting values, hiding the very photo
   the agent had just been asking about. Fixed by making Reject's own state
   an append-only LIST of rounds (`rejectRounds`, each `{ reason,
   reasonSubmitted, stepIndex }`) instead of a few flat fields that get
   overwritten — every earlier round renders exactly as it finished
   (frozen), and only the LAST round is ever "live" (still asking for a
   reason, or still advancing its own `AIProcess`/photo reveal). Approve no
   longer touches `confirmed` at all — `approvedAfterReject` just appends
   `approveBlock` after the rounds, so the original "Refund rejected"
   summary and every round's own history stay exactly as they were,
   consistent with a real conversation where nothing already said gets
   retroactively erased.

   Per a later explicit request, clicking "Takeover" (`marcusWebbReviewing`
   flipping to `false`, `AgentWorkspaceAdvancedPage.tsx`) replaces
   EVERYTHING above with a hand-off moment (`takenOver` prop) — the
   original question(s) no longer make sense once a human is personally
   handling the call instead of directing the AI. A note ("Agent Smith has
   taken over the conversation.") plus a third option list
   (`REMEDY_OPTIONS`: Store Credit / Discount Code / Something else)
   replace them; picking one locks it in (`remedyConfirmed`) and fires
   `onRemedyIssued`. This is the third real use of
   `NextBestActionOptionPicker`'s radio+inline-confirm markup — it's
   generic over the option-value type now (`<T extends string>`) with an
   optional `noteFor` prop (`OPTIONS`/`PHOTO_DECISION_OPTIONS`/
   `REMEDY_OPTIONS` all set it, to `"something-else"`) rather than
   hardcoding that one value in. A separate, short-delay pair of
   transcript lines (the human agent's own
   greeting, then the customer's reply — `onTakeoverGreeting`/
   `onCustomerRespondedToTakeover`) plays out independently of when the
   agent actually picks a remedy, same "narration is real transcript
   effects the caller applies" pattern as everywhere else on this card. Per
   explicit answer, issuing a remedy does NOT change the session status or
   dismiss the assignment — unlike Approve/the flag flow, this one's
   completion is left for the reviewing agent to wrap up manually.

   Per a later explicit request ("the action should be recorded inline with
   the contact"), every real action above now also appends to a growing,
   append-only `actionLog` (`MarcusWebbActionLogEntry[]`), rendered right
   below the context bullets — visible no matter which state the rest of
   the card is currently in, same "nothing already recorded gets erased"
   principle as `rejectRounds`. Two kinds:
   - **`"simple"`** — a bare timestamp + bold title, no icon/border/click
     target. For plain milestones only (per explicit decision, not every
     timer-driven `AIProcess` sub-step, which is already visible live in
     those step lists): the photo arriving, the disposition/status
     changes, and Takeover starting.
   - **`"note"`** — a bordered card (icon + title + timestamp + actor +
     trailing chevron, a description line below); clicking one fires
     `onActionLogEntryOpen` so the caller can show its `detail` (the
     question that was asked, every option that was available, which one
     was picked) in a side panel. For the three genuine DECISIONS on this
     card (the top-level question, the post-photo question, the remedy
     question) — each already `RadioGroup`+confirm-backed. Every note's
     `actorName` is hardcoded `"John Smith"` (per explicit decision) — this
     card still has no concept of the page's own current-agent name beyond
     that one hardcoded string, matching the "Agent Smith"/"John Smith"
     split already established for Takeover's own narration.
   Reject's own top-level decision is a special case: unlike Approve/
   Something-else (whose descriptive text exists the instant they're
   confirmed), Reject's "why" isn't known until the reason `Textarea` is
   submitted a step later — so its note logs then instead (same moment as
   `rejectionNoteFiredRef`'s transcript note), not at the moment of
   confirming. Every later round's own reason submission gets its own
   follow-up note the same way. */

 *  message bubble holding the question text and (while it's still the
 *  live `activeQuestionItem`) its options below it. Modeled on lyra-ui's
 *  `ChatMessage` (`chat-message.tsx`) — same avatar size/shape
 *  (`h-7 w-7 rounded-full`), same bubble corner squared toward the avatar
 *  (`rounded-tl-none`), same gray "other party" bubble background
 *  (`bg-lyra-state-hover`), and the same `"{timestamp} · {name}"` header
 *  convention already established there — built locally rather than
 *  reusing `ChatMessage` directly since that component takes a plain
 *  `initials: string` for its avatar (not an icon) and has no notion of
 *  "keep rendering after answered, just without the options." Full width
 *  (not `ChatMessage`'s `max-w-[80%]`) since it holds real form content,
 *  not a short text message.
 *
 *  Per explicit follow-up (screenshot 2), the bubble's TEXT stays visible
 *  once its question has been answered — it doesn't disappear the way
 *  the old `Accordion`-based card used to — only its options go away.
 *  This component itself doesn't know "answered or not"; the caller
 *  simply stops passing `children` once the question is no longer the
 *  live `activeQuestionItem` (see `askedQuestions`, below).
 *
 *  `title` widened from `string` to `React.ReactNode` (and its own
 *  `<p>` wrapper dropped in favor of the caller supplying its own markup)
 *  per a later explicit request: the top-level bubble's intro is now a
 *  multi-paragraph narrative with inline links (see its own call site),
 *  which can't be wrapped in a single outer `<p>`. Remedies/photo-decision
 *  still just pass a plain string, wrapped in their own `<p>` at their own
 *  call sites — see `activeQuestionItem`'s `"remedies"`/`"photo-decision"`
 *  branches.
 *
 *  `animate-in slide-in-from-bottom-4 fade-in-0 duration-200` on the
 *  outer wrapper — see `ActionLogSimpleEntry`'s own doc comment for the

 *  bubble guarantee: `askedQuestions`/the completion bubble/etc. all key
 *  each `MarcusWebbAiChatBubble` by a stable id, so this only plays once
 *  per bubble, the moment it first appears).
 *
 *  Per explicit follow-up (with a reference screenshot comparing this
 *  against a real customer `ChatMessage` bubble), the "{timestamp} ·
 *  Cognigy AI Agent" header used to sit on its OWN line above the whole
 *  avatar+bubble row — `ChatMessage` instead keeps the avatar and header
 *  in the SAME row (header inside the content column beside the avatar,
 *  directly above the bubble), which is what actually aligns the header
 *  text next to the avatar instead of floating disconnected above it.
 *  Restructured to match exactly: the avatar row now wraps a content
 *  column (`flex min-w-0 flex-1 flex-col gap-1`) holding the header THEN
 *  the bubble, mirroring `chat-message.tsx`'s own
 *  `flex items-start gap-2` → `flex min-w-0 flex-col gap-1` shape. */

/** The top-level bubble's own options UI — per explicit request ("I would
 *  like this to feel like a conversation with the AI agent so restyle
 *  all three for now"), a "task card" instead of `NextBestActionOption
 *  Picker`'s stacked radio-cards: options render as a row of pill
 *  buttons (title only), the SELECTED option's own description shows
 *  below the row (not every option's, unlike the old picker), a note
 *  field appears there too when the option has one, and a single
 *  "Perform Task" button replaces the old per-row/per-note
 *  `InlineSubmitButton`. Originally used ONLY for the top-level question;
 *  per explicit follow-up request ("display the remedies like the
 *  buttons in the first bubble (inline 3 up)"), the post-takeover
 *  remedies question was migrated onto this SAME component too (see its
 *  own `activeQuestionItem` branch) — `heading`/`extra` (below) exist
 *  specifically to make that reuse possible without touching the
 *  top-level question's own behavior. Photo-decision still keeps
 *  `NextBestActionOptionPicker` exactly as shipped, unaffected.
 *
 *  `heading` — the bold line above the pill row ("How would you like to
 *  proceed?" for the top-level question, "Suggested remedies" for
 *  remedies) — used to be hardcoded to the former; lifted to a prop so a
 *  second caller can supply its own. Omit for no heading at all.
 *
 *  `extra` — arbitrary content rendered for whichever option is
 *  currently selected, right after that option's own `description`/
 *  `note` (if any) and before "Perform Task". Built for remedies' own
 *  per-option follow-ups (`store-credit`'s editable amount `Input`,
 *  `discount-code`'s 3-way percentage picker — see `MarcusWebbNextBestAction
 *  Card`'s own `remedyExtra`) that don't fit the existing plain-`Textarea`
 *  `notes` shape; the top-level question doesn't use it (always
 *  `undefined` there). Deliberately independent of `notes` — an option
 *  can have `extra`, a `note`, both, or neither.
 *
 *  `phase` drives what actually renders once a task is performed:
 *  `"picking"` is this row-of-buttons state (covers "nothing chosen
 *  yet," a chosen-but-not-yet-confirmed option, AND — since Reject and
 *  Something else don't have their own completion screens yet — is also
 *  what's showing right up until either of those actually fires); the
 *  caller (see `topLevelPhase`, computed in `MarcusWebbNextBestAction
 *  Card`) only ever passes `"processing"`/`"completed"` for Approve.
 *  Both `"processing"` and `"completed"` render nothing HERE — per
 *  explicit follow-up ("the processing approval should show after the
 *  refund approved note, not inside the AI chat bubble"), the
 *  `approveBlock`/`AIProcess` "Processing the approval" loader stays in
 *  its ORIGINAL position instead (the "pure history" block, after the
 *  action log's "Refund approved" entry — see `MarcusWebbNextBestAction
 *  Card`'s own render), and the completion message/buttons (screenshot
 *  3) are their own separate new chat bubble, further below still (see
 *  `completionTimestamp`'s own render call site). This component's job
 *  ends once a task is confirmed — everything after that is someone
 *  else's render. */

// Marcus Webb — a scripted, one-off simulated INBOUND chat for "Agent
// Workspace 2.0 Premium" only (per explicit request — this module is never
// imported by AgentNextGenPage.tsx/AgentWorkspaceAdvancedPage.tsx). Unlike
// every other interaction-creation path in that file (`handleStartCall`,
// `handleQuickDial`, `handleRedial`, `handleReopenContactHistoryEntry`,
// `handleOpenAssignmentFromNotification`), which all start from an AGENT
// action, this one starts itself: 30 real seconds after the agent's status
// reads "available" (`AgentWorkspace2WithDeskPage.tsx`'s own trigger
// `useEffect`), a chat from "Marcus Webb" — locked out of his account after
// several failed password-reset attempts — lands in the left nav exactly
// like a real inbound assignment, unprompted.
//
// "Separate from the customer database" (per explicit request): `Marcus
// Webb` is NOT a `CREATE_NEW_CUSTOMERS` record — `MARCUS_WEBB_CUSTOMER_ID`
// matches nothing in that array on purpose. Contact History still gets a
// real entry for him anyway, for free, the exact same way every other
// dismissed interaction does — `handleDismissInteraction`'s own
// `buildDismissedContactHistoryEntry` call doesn't care whether the
// dismissed interaction's `customerId` belongs to a real directory record,
// only that an agent message was actually sent on it (see that handler's
// own doc comment) — no separate Contact History code needed here at all.
//
// Persistence ("remembered ... (local storage)", per explicit request):
// within a single page load, an agent's action log (which option they
// picked, whether they marked the steps complete, which reply they sent)
// stays in `localStorage` via this module's `save`/`load` pair — the same
// mechanism `agent-next-gen-case-database.ts` uses for every other
// interaction — so a component re-render (or a sibling component reading
// the same key) never loses that in-progress state.
//
// ACROSS a page reload, though, this scenario is deliberately reset to
// square one every time (`resetMarcusWebbScenario()`, called from
// `AgentWorkspace2WithDeskPage.tsx`'s own `marcusWebbState` initializer) —
// per explicit report ("it should reset when the user reloads the page, I
// can't have people opening the dev console each time"). An earlier version
// of this module instead rehydrated `triggered`/`interaction`/`copilotStep`
// from `localStorage` on mount so a refresh mid-scenario would resume
// exactly where the agent left off — that's no longer the goal: this is a
// demo scenario meant to be easy to re-trigger on demand (open DevTools and
// manually clear one `localStorage` key isn't a reasonable ask of anyone
// running the demo), so a plain reload is now itself the reset action, full
// stop, with no mid-scenario-survival case to weigh against it.

// removed along with it, rather than left as dead exports.

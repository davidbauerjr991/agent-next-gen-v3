/**
 * PROTOTYPE — local to agent-next-gen-v2 only. NOT in lyra-ui yet.
 *
 * Overlays the interaction's current channel icon on the top-left corner
 * of a collapsed (icon-rail) `InteractionNavItem` tile, so a collapsed
 * LeftNav still communicates which channel a card is on without expanding
 * it.
 *
 * Built on lyra-ui's own `Badge` (`shape="circle"`) — the same "status icon
 * on an avatar corner" pattern `Badge.stories.tsx`'s "On an avatar (status
 * icon — matches AgentProfile's StatusIcon)" story documents, just resized
 * from that story's `size="sm"` (16px) to a custom 18x18 (`h-[18px]
 * w-[18px]` override — none of `Badge`'s own sm/md/lg tokens land on 18px)
 * to match `InteractionNavItem`'s own channel-count badge (the "2" on a
 * multi-channel card, `interaction-nav-item.tsx`) exactly, since the two
 * occupy the same top-left corner (see this component's only call site,
 * `AgentNextGenPage.tsx`, which skips rendering this one at all once that
 * count badge is showing instead — a card can only show one or the other).
 * Rule zero: reuse `Badge`, don't hand-roll the circle as a bare `<span>`.
 *
 * Colors follow lyra-ui's own canonical channel-type convention
 * (`CONTRIBUTING.md`'s "Channel type colors (canonical reference)"):
 * Voice = purple, Chat/SMS/WhatsApp = teal, Email = pink — the same
 * soft-bg/strong-icon pairing `Tag`'s subtle channel-type chips use (see
 * `tag.tsx`'s `purple`/`teal`/`pink` variants), including its tinted
 * `color-mix()` border (`CHANNEL_TYPE_ACCENT` below). `Badge`'s circle
 * `variant` only covers 6 semantic roles (no true purple/teal/pink), so
 * these are applied as a `className` override on top of it instead. A
 * solid `-strong`-fill/white-icon "status badge" look was tried first, but
 * reverted: `accent-*-strong` inverts to pastel/light in dark mode (by
 * design, since it's meant to pair with each color's own `-soft`
 * background as FOREGROUND text, not serve as a background itself), which
 * broke white-icon contrast badly in dark mode — this soft/strong pairing
 * is the one lyra-ui actually built (and tested) for this exact combo, and
 * it stays WCAG-safe in both themes for free. The real source of truth for
 * the type→color mapping is `CHANNEL_TYPE_TAG_VARIANT` (`channel-row.tsx`),
 * but it isn't exported from lyra-ui's public index today — re-derived
 * here rather than reached into internally. Once this promotes into
 * lyra-ui proper, wire straight to that export instead of this local copy.
 *
 * Positioning is an external CSS overlay since `InteractionNavItem`'s
 * compact tile has no slot for this today — the consumer wraps the tile in
 * a `relative` container and drops this in as an absolutely-positioned
 * sibling. That wrapper coincides exactly with the tile's own outer box
 * (Radix's `Popover.Trigger asChild` — the tile's only ancestor inside
 * `InteractionNavItem` — clones its child rather than adding a wrapper
 * element, and the LeftNav header row it sits in is `items-center`, i.e.
 * shrink-wrapped, not stretched, so no extra sizing is introduced either).
 * The internal "2" count badge (interaction-nav-item.tsx), by contrast, is
 * positioned `-left-1.5 -top-1.5` against the AVATAR SPAN specifically,
 * which itself sits inset by the tile's own `p-1.5` (6px) padding — so its
 * -6px offset exactly cancels that 6px inset and lands flush on the tile's
 * true outer corner. This component's wrapper has no such padding to
 * cancel out, so matching that same final on-screen position takes `left-0
 * top-0` here, not a copy of that same `-left-1.5 -top-1.5` value. Once
 * promoted into lyra-ui proper, this should become a real prop on
 * `InteractionNavItem` itself (rendered from inside, against the avatar
 * span directly) rather than a sibling reasoning about someone else's
 * padding from outside — see `../../CLAUDE.md`'s lyra-ui rules for why
 * this stays local until then.

// purple/teal/pink channel-type `Tag`/chip already uses (see that file's
// own doc comment for why this needs a `color-mix()` arbitrary value
// rather than Tailwind's slash-opacity syntax: the design tokens are CSS
// custom properties holding full color strings, not raw RGB/HSL channels,
// so a slash modifier on them silently generates no CSS at all). `-soft`/
// `-strong` both invert together correctly across light/dark themes (see
// this file's own top doc comment), so this pairing is WCAG-safe in both
// without any extra handling.

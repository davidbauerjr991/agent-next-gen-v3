/* ── Contact History card (home tab, below Performance/Productivity) ──
   A recent-customer-contacts summary — name, resolution status, a one-line
   case summary, case ID, and (right-aligned) the channel + how long ago it
   happened, plus the handle time. The base 5 rows (`CONTACT_HISTORY`) are
   from a screenshot of exactly this content, so those values are that
   screenshot's own data, not derived from any other part of the app.
   Composed entirely from existing lyra-ui atoms — `DashboardCard` for the
   card shell (`headerActions` holding this card's own
   `ContactHistoryDateFilterChip` — a separate, 3-option "Today / Last 48
   Hours / Last 72 Hours" control, not the shared `DateFilterChip` the
   Performance/Productivity cards' headers use, since this card's range
   options and cumulative-window semantics are its own — see
   `ContactHistoryDateFilterValue`'s own doc comment for why), and `Badge`
   (`shape="circle" dot`) + plain text for the status indicator
   (critical=red/Escalated, info=blue/In Progress, success=green/Resolved,
   neutral=gray/New) — no hand-rolled badge/pill markup.

   Per explicit request: clicking a row no longer reopens the contact
   directly. It instead opens this same entry's summary
   (`ContactHistoryEntryDetail` below) in `AgentNextGenPage`'s shared
   right-docked `InteriorPanel` slot — the same panel type the home tab's
   Queue widgets already drill into (`selectedQueueId`), just a third job
   for that one slot (see that file's own doc comment on why one slot
   serves multiple jobs). "Redial" (voice contacts only, reusing the same
   `PhoneOutgoing` icon `InteractionRowActions`' kebab menu already uses for
   its own "Redial" action) and "Re-open" (reusing the same `RotateCcw` icon
   that same menu's own "Reopen" entry uses) now live as footer buttons on
   that panel instead of directly on the row — clicking either is what
   actually reopens the contact as a live assignment in the left nav (the
   row's own previous click behavior), read the summary first.

   Row set is driven by the selected date range (`buildContactHistoryByRange`):
   "Today" starts EMPTY on login — there's no real backend here to have
   loaded any actual prior-contact history from, so this app no longer
   pretends otherwise with hand-authored placeholder rows the way it used
   to (a `TODAY_CONTACT_HISTORY` fixture, since removed). "Today" instead
   fills in for real, as the agent actually works: "Unassign & Dismiss"ing
   a whole assignment (`handleDismissInteraction`, main component) is what
   counts as a completed contact in this demo, and appends a genuine
   `ContactHistoryEntry` (`buildDismissedContactHistoryEntry`) onto
   `dismissedContactHistory` state — the one truly live piece of this
   card's data. Dismissing does NOT change that entry's status, though: it
   logs at the same neutral "Resolved" default every hand-authored
   `CONTACT_HISTORY` row's own closed-the-loop case uses, never a forced
   "Closed"/read-only one — an earlier pass tried that and it conflated
   leaving an assignment (a LeftNav/UI action) with the assignment's own
   status (a real-world fact about the case); per explicit follow-up,
   dismissing must never itself decide or change that. "Last 48 Hours"
   adds the 5 hand-authored `CONTACT_HISTORY` rows on top of whatever's
   been dismissed so far; "Last 72 Hours" adds 5 more
   (`EXTENDED_CONTACT_HISTORY`) pulled from the shared customer "database"
   (`CREATE_NEW_CUSTOMERS`, the same fixture `OUTBOUND_CUSTOMERS` above
   already sources from) rather than inventing unrelated names. Each range
   is a strict superset of the one before it — today's own (dismissed)
   rows never disappear just because a wider range is selected. */

/** Summary content shown in `AgentNextGenPage`'s shared right-docked
 *  `InteriorPanel` slot when a Contact History row is clicked (that file's
 *  own `selectedContactHistoryEntry` state) — same "one-line status ·
 *  handle · when" meta line, then a bordered card with Duration + a notes
 *  field, that the Customer Information panel's own past-session
 *  "Conversation" tab already uses for its voice entries
 *  (`CustomerHistoryConversationContent` in
 *  agent-next-gen-customer-info-panel.tsx), reused here for visual
 *  consistency between the two "read a past contact's summary" experiences
 *  in this app. Not imported from that file directly, to avoid a circular
 *  import (that file already imports `ContactHistoryStatusVariant` from
 *  this one) — this is a small enough shape to redeclare locally instead.
 *
 *  `ContactHistoryEntry` (this card's own, simpler data shape) has no
 *  separate message-thread/email-subject fields to branch its layout on
 *  the way that richer `CustomerHistorySessionEntry` type does, and no real
 *  captured Date/timestamp either — every channel type here just shows
 *  `duration` + `description` under one notes label ("Call Notes" for
 *  voice, matching that same convention's own wording; "Chat Summary"/
 *  "Email Summary" for the other two), and the meta line uses `timeAgo`
 *  (a relative string, e.g. "8m ago") in place of that other panel's real
 *  formatted timestamp.
 *
 *  Per explicit follow-up request, the meta line's middle segment is
 *  `contactHistoryDisplayIdentity(entry)` (phone/email/WhatsApp handle,
 *  falling back to name only for Chat/unpopulated fields — see that
 *  function's own doc comment), not `entry.name` — the panel's own
 *  `headerTitle` (this component's caller, `AgentNextGenPage.tsx` et al.)
 *  already shows the customer's real name immediately above this line, so
 *  repeating it here was pure duplication (a customer's name showing up
 *  twice back to back). Unlike `ContactHistoryCard`'s own identical-looking
 *  swap, this one isn't gated behind `hideCustomerNames` — it always shows
 *  the handle, in every tier, since the point here isn't masking a name but
 *  avoiding restating one already on screen.
 *
 *  Per a further explicit follow-up ("please display the transcript/email
 *  body content/chat below the info box"), a second section renders below
 *  the Duration/notes box: voice/chat/SMS/WhatsApp rows get a synthesized
 *  message thread (`buildContactHistoryMessages`), and email rows get a
 *  synthesized, longer "Body" (`buildContactHistoryEmailBody`) distinct
 *  from the info box's own short summary. See those builders' own doc
 *  comments for why none of this is case-specific.
 *
 *  Per one more explicit follow-up on a voice row's own screenshot ("for
 *  voice can you have a fake transcript?" — then, with a reference
 *  screenshot of the desired layout: "i would prefer the voice transcript
 *  formatting like this"), voice's own section is labeled "Transcript"
 *  (the other three stay "Conversation") and renders each turn with
 *  `ContactHistoryTranscriptLine` (bold name + timestamp, spoken line
 *  below — see that component's own doc comment) instead of
 *  `ContactHistoryMessageBubble`'s chat-bubble layout, matching that
 *  reference screenshot exactly. */

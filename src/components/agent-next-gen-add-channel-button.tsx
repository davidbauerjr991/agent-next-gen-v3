// AddChannelAdHocButton — 2.0's record header "+" Add Channel trigger (see
// AgentNextGenPage.tsx's own `showAddChannelActions` render call site).
//
// Restored per explicit follow-up request after being deleted during the
// Premium/Advanced "Phase D" simplification (which swapped THEIR "+" trigger
// over to lyra-ui's own stock `OutboundAddButton`/`getHeaderAction` picker —
// see BEHAVIOR.md §23). That swap doesn't work for 2.0: `getHeaderAction`
// looks up the interaction's own id in `outboundConfig.groups` (the real
// customer/agent directory) to build its button, and returns `null` — no
// button at all — for any id that isn't a real, known contact (see
// `handleRedial`'s own doc comment for a fully-worked example of this exact
// bug). Since 2.0 has "no real customer database" by design (every
// interaction is 1:1, frequently a raw quick-dialed number or other ad-hoc
// contact with no backing directory record), that lookup fails often enough
// that the standard picker silently disappears for exactly the customers who
// need it most. This ad-hoc-only popup sidesteps the directory lookup
// entirely — it never calls `getHeaderAction`/`useOutboundAddButton` at all,
// so it always renders and always works, regardless of whether the active
// interaction has a real contact record behind it.
//
// Deliberately a plain presentational component, not wired to the page's own
// `interactions` state directly — `onLaunch` hands the typed query and
// detected channel back to whichever page rendered this, so that page can
// add the new Thread onto ITS OWN currently active interaction using its own
// `setInteractions`/`clockTick`/`generateContactId` (see
// AgentNextGenPage.tsx's own `handleAddAdHocChannel`). Shared here (not
// hand-duplicated per page) since none of that page-specific wiring lives
// inside this component at all — only the popover's own open/typed-value UI
// state does.

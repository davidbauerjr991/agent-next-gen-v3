// A tiny embedded "local database" for full `Interaction` records — the
// piece Contact History was missing. Every OTHER piece of state in this app
// (`interactions`, `dismissedContactHistory`, ...) lives only in React
// state: the moment "Unassign & Dismiss" removes an `Interaction` from
// `interactions`, every `Thread`, every `liveMessages` entry, and every
// per-channel `threadStatuses` value it held went with it — all Contact
// History ever kept was `buildDismissedContactHistoryEntry`'s own lossy,
// single-channel SUMMARY (`ContactHistoryEntry`), not the real underlying
// record. `handleReopenContactHistoryEntry` then had nothing to rebuild
// from except that summary, so it had to fabricate a brand-new `Thread` —
// a fresh synthesized address (a new "tab" for the same channel type
// instead of the one the customer actually messaged on), empty
// `liveMessages` (the whole conversation gone), and a status pulled from
// the summary's own single `statusLabel` rather than the real per-channel
// `threadStatuses` map it was actually last left at (wrong the moment an
// interaction had more than one open channel, or the primary channel
// picked by `buildDismissedContactHistoryEntry` wasn't the one the agent
// cared about).
//
// This module is the fix: every dismissed `Interaction` is written here,
// byte-for-byte, BEFORE it's removed from `interactions` — keyed by
// `customerId` (`ContactHistoryEntry.caseId`), the one identity that's
// stable across the whole life of a case (see that field's own doc
// comment in agent-next-gen-contact-history.tsx). `handleReopenContactHistoryEntry`
// reads it back out by that same key and restores the exact record it
// saved, rather than reconstructing a guess — the same Thread ids/
// addresses, the same liveMessages, the same threadStatuses. A real
// backend would just be a database row per case; this is the closest a
// browser-only prototype gets to one: an in-memory cache (so nothing ever
// waits on I/O mid-render) backed by `localStorage` (so it's a genuine
// local *database* — writes actually persist across a reload, not just
// for the rest of this in-memory session).
//
// Deliberately narrow: this only ever stores/restores whatever a real
// `Interaction` already looked like at save time. It does NOT hydrate
// `interactions` state on page load (that would resurrect every past case
// straight into the left nav on every refresh, a much bigger behavior
// change nobody asked for) — it only answers "what did case X last look
// like," on demand, for Contact History's own Re-open flow to use.
import type { Interaction } from "@/components/agent-next-gen-interaction-dashboard";

// Bumped v1 -> v2 (per explicit bug report: "Omar Farooq shows his name
// instead of his email", "Priya Shah opens as a Voice instead of Chat") —
// browsers that tested this prototype across the several rounds of Contact
// History fixes in this same running session/tab (never a hard reload)
// still have real, saved-under-v1 `Interaction` records for these
// customer ids from BEFORE those fixes existed: whatever `customerName`/
// `Thread.type` an old, since-corrected code path actually built at the
// time is frozen in there, byte-for-byte, and every reopen dutifully
// restores it exactly as saved — that's this whole module's job, not a
// bug in `getCaseRecord` itself (see its own doc comment). Changing the
// key is the clean way to retire that now-stale generation of records
// without trying to detect/migrate individual bad fields: `readCache`
// simply finds nothing under the new key and starts fresh, so the very
// next reopen falls through to `handleReopenContactHistoryEntry`'s own
// synthesized-`Thread` branch and rebuilds the record under today's rules
// (correct `customerName`/`type`/address) instead of resurrecting
// yesterday's. Orphaned v1 data is harmless dead weight in `localStorage`,
// not read again by anything.

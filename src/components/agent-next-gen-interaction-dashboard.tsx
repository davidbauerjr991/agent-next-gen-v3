/* ── Left nav interactions ──
   Live InteractionNavItem cards launched from CreateNew above — see
   lyra-ui's AgentNextGenTemplate.stories.tsx for the reference
   implementation this mirrors. No cards exist until the agent actually
   starts one; starting a second channel with a contact who already has a
   card folds it into that same card *only* when it's the same channel type
   on the same address (restarting its timer) — a different address on the
   same type (e.g. a second SMS thread on a different number) opens as its
   own additional row instead of replacing the first, since it's a genuinely
   separate conversation. "Unassign & Dismiss" (any channel's kebab menu)
   removes just that channel via InteractionNavItem's `onDismissChannel`
   when others are still open, or the whole card via `onDismiss` when it was
   the last one — see `handleDismissChannel`/`handleDismissInteraction`. */

   * Outcome button (same underlying value, see `ChannelOutcomeConfig`'s
   * `resolution`) — keyed by `Thread.id`, ONE entry per open
   * channel, not a single interaction-wide value. This used to be a lone
   * `currentStatus?: string` applying to whichever channel happened to be
   * "current" — a real, confirmed bug: closing one channel (say, a chat
   * thread) set that one shared field, which then leaked onto every OTHER
   * channel on the same card the moment the agent switched tabs to it (its
   * own separate voice/email/SMS conversation would suddenly read
   * "Closed" too, and the composer would stay hidden for it), since
   * nothing distinguished which channel a status change actually applied
   * to. Per-channel keys fix that: each channel's own entry is independent,
   * so closing one never touches any sibling channel's own status.
   *
   * Undefined for a channel until the agent actually changes its status,
   * at which point that channel's own current session's hardcoded default
   * status (`Contact.status`) still applies. A channel that's
   * restarted at the same id (e.g. redialing the same number, reusing
   * `Thread.id`) has its entry explicitly cleared first (see
   * `withoutChannelStatus`) rather than silently inheriting whatever it
   * was left at before — a reopened channel should read as freshly open,
   * not still "Closed" under its own reused id.
   *
   * Kept here, on `Interaction` itself, for the same reason
   * `liveMessages`/`closed` are — `InteractionTranscript` isn't remounted
   * per-interaction (no `key` prop at its call site), so a status held only
   * in that component's own local state wouldn't actually travel with a
   * specific interaction: switching to a different interaction and back
   * would either lose it, or (worse, since `TRANSCRIPT_SESSIONS`' session
   * ids are literally shared/static across every chat/SMS/WhatsApp
   * interaction) leak one interaction's status onto a completely different
   * one that happens to render the same session id.
   *
   * Read by `buildDismissedContactHistoryEntry` when "Unassign & Dismiss"
   * logs this interaction to Contact History (falls back to "Resolved" if
   * never explicitly set — see that function's own comment) — per explicit
   * request, the logged row should reflect whatever status was actually
   * last assigned, not always "Resolved". Written back onto a freshly
   * reopened interaction by `handleReopenContactHistoryEntry` (from
   * `entry.statusLabel`), so reopening a dismissed (or hand-authored)
   * Contact History row picks its (single, freshly-built) thread back up
   * in that same status instead of resetting to whatever hardcoded default
   * status `TRANSCRIPT_SESSIONS`/`_VOICE`/`_EMAIL` otherwise assigns it.

   carries in this prototype (see `startTick`'s own doc comment) — no
   separate "last activity" field exists to track finer-grained events (a
   new message, a status change, etc.), so "most recently added a channel"
   is the closest real proxy available for "most recently updated." Both
   orders sort newest-first (descending), the conventional default for
   either reading.

   "Longest Wait" is the third option — the actual response-urgency
   queue: ranks by the OLDEST `lastCustomerMessageTick` among each card's
   awaiting channels (the smallest tick = the longest anyone's been
   waiting), ascending, so the single longest-waiting card sorts first.
   Cards with nothing currently awaiting sort to `Infinity` — they sink to
   the very bottom regardless of how "Last Updated"/"Create Date" would have
   placed them, since this view's whole point is surfacing what needs a
   reply, not everything open. Note this ranks by the CUSTOMER's own last-

   on where it landed before settling back here), with the list of
   InteractionNavItem cards below it — both this caption and the cards

   (LeftNav's default, non-`itemsFirst` order), sticky to the BOTTOM of the

   Collapsed to icon-only rail (`expanded` false), the text has nowhere to

   button — removed per explicit follow-up: sorting by "Longest Wait"

   icon matching its own label (not a single icon reused across every row),

   the Activity/Productivity cards already use: same icons

   the live copy in `queueSubItems` state (see "Live queue simulation" near

   (see `sumInQueue` below), not an independently-randomized number.
